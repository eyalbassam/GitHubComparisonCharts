9,100060912,2,C++,Windows Terminal Roadmap. The plan for the Windows Terminal is described here(/doc/roadmap-2023.md) and will be updated as the project proceeds.
10,100060912,2,C++,Terminal & Console Overview. Please take a few minutes to review the overview below before diving into the code:
11,100060912,3,C++,"Windows Terminal. Windows Terminal is a new, modern, feature-rich, productive terminal application for command-line users. It includes many of the features most frequently requested by the Windows command-line community including support for tabs, rich text, globalization, configurability, theming & styling, and more. The Terminal will also need to meet our goals and measures to ensure it remains fast and efficient, and doesn't consume vast amounts of memory or power."
12,100060912,3,C++,"The Windows Console Host. The Windows Console host, conhost.exe, is Windows' original command-line user experience. It also hosts Windows' command-line infrastructure and the Windows Console API server, input engine, rendering engine, user preferences, etc. The console host code in this repository is the actual source from which the conhost.exe in Windows itself is built. Since taking ownership of the Windows command-line in 2014, the team added several new features to the Console, including background transparency, line-based selection, support for ANSI / Virtual Terminal sequences @link , 24-bit color @link , a Pseudoconsole ('ConPTY') @link , and more. However, because Windows Console's primary goal is to maintain backward compatibility, we have been unable to add many of the features the community (and the team) have been wanting for the last several years including tabs, unicode text, and emoji. These limitations led us to create the new Windows Terminal. You can read more about the evolution of the command-line in general, and the Windows command-line specifically in this accompanying series of blog posts @link on the Command-Line team's blog."
13,100060912,3,C++,"Shared Components. While overhauling Windows Console, we modernized its codebase considerably, cleanly separating logical entities into modules and classes, introduced some key extensibility points, replaced several old, home-grown collections and containers with safer, more efficient STL containers @link , and made the code simpler and safer by using Microsoft's Windows Implementation Libraries - WIL @link . This overhaul resulted in several of Console's key components being available for re-use in any terminal implementation on Windows. These components include a new DirectWrite-based text layout and rendering engine, a text buffer capable of storing both UTF-16 and UTF-8, a VT parser/emitter, and more."
14,100060912,3,C++,"Creating the new Windows Terminal. When we started planning the new Windows Terminal application, we explored and evaluated several approaches and technology stacks. We ultimately decided that our goals would be best met by continuing our investment in our C codebase, which would allow us to reuse several of the aforementioned modernized components in both the existing Console and the new Terminal. Further, we realized that this would allow us to build much of the Terminal's core itself as a reusable UI control that others can incorporate into their own applications. The result of this work is contained within this repo and delivered as the Windows Terminal application you can download from the Microsoft Store, or directly from this repo's releases @link . ---"

25,1062572,2,C++,"What is Catch2?. Catch2 is mainly a unit testing framework for C, but it also provides basic micro-benchmarking features, and simple BDD macros. Catch2's main advantage is that using it is both simple and natural. Test names do not have to be valid identifiers, assertions look like normal C boolean expressions, and sections provide a nice and local way to share set-up and tear-down code in tests. Example unit test @Code _Note that benchmarks are not run by default, so you need to run it explicitly with the !benchmark tag._"
26,1062572,2,C++,"Catch2 v3 has been released!. You are on the devel branch, where the v3 version is being developed. v3 brings a bunch of significant changes, the big one being that Catch2 is no longer a single-header library. Catch2 now behaves as a normal library, with multiple headers and separately compiled implementation. The documentation is slowly being updated to take these changes into account, but this work is currently still ongoing. For migrating from the v2 releases to v3, you should look at our documentation(docs/migrate-v2-to-v3.mdtop).

52,11276147,3,C++,"Access to multiple shells in one window using tabs. You can open multiple tabs each containing one of the following shells: Cmder, PowerShell, and Bash tabs all run on top of the Windows Console API and work as you might expect in Cmder with access to use ConEmu's color schemes, key bindings and other settings defined in the ConEmu Settings dialog. Note: Only the full edition of Cmder comes with a pre-installed bash, using a vendored git-for-windows @link  installation. The pre-configured Bash tabs may not work on Cmder mini edition without additional configuration. You may however, choose to use an external installation of bash, such as Microsoft's Subsystem for Linux @link  (called WSL) or the Cygwin @link  project which provides POSIX support on windows. Note: Mintty tabs use a program called 'mintty' as the terminal emulator that is not based on the Windows Console API, rather it's rendered graphically by ConEmu. Mintty differs from the other tabs in that it supports xterm/xterm-256color TERM types, and does not work with ConEmu settings like color schemes and key bindings.  As such, some differences in functionality are to be expected, such as Cmder not being able to apply a system-wide configuration to it.

56,11276147,3,C++,Cmder Shell User Config. Single user portable configuration is possible using the Cmder specific shell config files.  Edit the below files to add your own configuration: Note: Bash and Mintty sessions will also source the $HOME/.bashrc file if it exists after it sources $CMDER_ROOT/config/user_profile.sh. You can write .cmd
57,11276147,4,C++,Git Status Opt-Out. To disable Cmder prompt git status globally add the following to /.gitconfig or locally for a single repo repo/.git/config and start a new session. Note: This configuration is not portable @Code
58,11276147,4,C++,Cmder(Cmd.exe) Aliases. You can define simple aliases for cmd.exe sessions with a command like alias namecommand.  Cmd.exe aliases support optional parameters through the $1-9 or the $ special characters so the alias vivim.exe $ typed as vi filename will open filename in vim.exe. Cmd.exe aliases can also be more complex. See: DOSKEY.EXE documentation @link  for additional details on complex aliases/macros for cmd.exe Aliases defined using the alias.bat command will automatically be saved in the %CMDER_ROOT%\config\user_aliases.cmd file To make an alias and/or any other profile settings permanent add it to one of the following: Note: These are loaded in this order by $CMDER_ROOT/vendor/init.bat.  Anything stored in %CMDER_ROOT% will be a portable setting and will follow Cmder to another machine. %CMDER_ROOT%\config\profile.d\.cmd and \.bat %CMDER_ROOT%\config\user_aliases.cmd %CMDER_ROOT%\config\user_profile.cmd
59,11276147,4,C++,Bash.exeBash shells support simple and complex aliases with optional parameters natively so they work a little different.  Typing alias namecommand will create an alias only for the current running session. To make an alias and/or any other profile settings permanent add it to one of the following: Note: These are loaded in this order by $CMDER_ROOT/vendor/git-for-windows/etc/profile.d/cmder.sh.  Anything stored in $CMDER_ROOT will be a portable setting and will follow Cmder to another machine. $CMDER_ROOT/config/profile.d/.sh $CMDER_ROOT/config/user_profile.sh $HOME/.bashrc If you add bash aliases to $CMDER_ROOT/config/user_profile.sh they will be portable and follow your Cmder folder if you copy it to another machine.  $HOME/.bashrc defined aliases are not portable.

62,11276147,3,C++,"Vendored Git. Cmder is by default shipped with a vendored Git installation.  On each instance of launching Cmder, an attempt is made to locate any other user provided Git binaries. Upon finding a git.exe binary, Cmder further compares its version against the vendored one _by executing_ it. The vendored git.exe binary is _only_ used when it is more recent than the user-installed one. You may use your favorite version of Git by including its path in the %PATH% environment variable.  Moreover, the Mini edition of Cmder (found on the downloads page @link ) excludes any vendored Git binaries."
63,11276147,3,C++,"Using external Cygwin/Babun, MSys2, WSL, or Git for Windows SDK with Cmder.. You may run bash (the default shell used on Linux, macOS and GNU/Hurd) externally on Cmder, using the following instructions: 1. Setup a new task by pressing Win Alt  T. 1. Click the  button to add a task. 1. Name the new task in the top text box. 1. Provide task parameters, this is optional. 1. Add cmd /c 'path_to_external_env\bin\bash --login -i' -new_console to the Commands text box. Recommended Optional Steps: Copy the vendor/cmder_exinit file to the Cygwin/Babun, MSys2, or Git for Windows SDK environments /etc/profile.d/ folder to use portable settings in the $CMDER_ROOT/config folder. Note: MinGW could work if the init scripts include profile.d but this has not been tested. The destination file extension depends on the shell you use in that environment.  For example: bash - Copy to /etc/profile.d/cmder_exinit.sh zsh  - Copy to /etc/profile.d/cmder_exinit.zsh Uncomment and edit the line below in the script to use Cmder config even when launched from outside Cmder. @Code"
64,11276147,3,C++,Customizing user sessions using init.bat custom arguments.. You can pass custom arguments to init.bat and use cexec.cmd in your user_profile.cmd to evaluate these arguments then execute commands based on a particular flag being detected or not. init.bat creates two shortcuts for using cexec.cmd in your profile scripts.

87,125098880,3,C++,"Configuring the build. @Code Running configure.sh will create a Makefile allowing you to build Proton. The scripts checks if containers are functional and prompt you if any host-side dependencies are missing. You should run the command from a directory created specifically for your build.

Check --help for other configuration options. NOTE: If SELinux is in use, the Proton build container may fail to access your user's files. This is caused by SELinux's filesystem labelsselinux-labels. You may pass the --relabel-volumes switch to configure to cause the container engine to relabel its bind-mountsbind-mounts and allow access to those files from within the container.

This target is only useful after building Proton. make dxvk / make vkd3d-proton - rebuild DXVK / vkd3d-proton."
89,125098880,3,C++,"Debug Builds. To prevent symbol stripping add UNSTRIPPED_BUILD1 to the make invocation. This should be used only with a clean build directory. E.g.: @Code Install Proton locally ---------------------- Steam ships with several versions of Proton, which games will use by default or that you can select in Steam Settings' Steam Play page. Steam also supports running games with local builds of Proton, which you can install on your machine. To install a local build of Proton into Steam, make a new directory in /.steam/root/compatibilitytools.d/ with a tool name of your choosing and place the directory containing your redistributable build under that path. The make install target will perform this task for you, installing the Proton build into the Steam folder for the current user. You will have to restart the Steam client for it to pick up on a new tool. A correct local tool installation should look similar to this: @Code To enable your local build in Steam, go to the Steam Play section of the Settings window. If the build was correctly installed, you should see 'proton-localbuild' in the drop-down list of compatibility tools. Each component of this software is used under the terms of their licenses. See the LICENSE files here, as well as the LICENSE, COPYING, etc files in each submodule and directory for details. If you distribute a built version of Proton to other users, you must adhere to the terms of these licenses. Debugging --------- Proton builds have their symbols stripped by default. You can switch to 'debug' beta branch in Steam (search for Proton in your library, Properties... - BETAS - select 'debug') or build without stripping (see Debug Builds section(debug-builds)).. The symbols are provided through the accompanying .debug files which may need to be explicitly loaded by the debugging tools. For GDB there's a helper script wine/tools/gdbinit.py (source it) that provides load-symbol-files (or lsf for short) command which loads the symbols for all the mapped files. For tips on debugging see docs/DEBUGGING.md(docs/DEBUGGING.md). compile_commands.json ----------------------- For use with clangd @link  LSP server and similar tooling. Projects built using cmake or meson (e.g. vkd3d-proton) automatically come with compile_commands.json. For autotools (e.g. wine) you have to configure the build(configuring-the-build) with --enable-bear that uses. bear @link  to create the compilation database. It's not on by default as it make the build slightly slower. The build system collects all the created compile_commands.json files in a build subdirectory named compile_commands/. The paths are translated to point to the real source (i.e. not the rsynced copy). It still may depend on build directory for things like auto-generated config.h though and for wine it may be beneficial to run tools/make_requests in you source directories as those changes are not committed. You can then configure your editor to use that file for clangd in a few ways: 1) directly - some editors/plugins allow you to specify the path to compile_commands.json 2) via .clangd file, e.g. bash cd src/proton/wine/ cat  .clangd"

Interested in adding textures, lighting, shadows, normal maps, glowing objects, ambient occlusion, reflections, refractions, and more to your 3D game? Great! Below is a collection of shading techniques that will take your game visuals to new heights. I've explained each technique in such a way that you can take what you learn here and apply/port it to whatever stack you use—be it Godot, Unity, Unreal, or something else. For the glue in between the shaders, I've chosen the fabulous Panda3D game engine and the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL). So if that is your stack, then you'll also get the benefit of learning how to use these shading techniques with Panda3D and OpenGL specifically."

169,19416551,2,C++,"What it is. _DB Browser for SQLite_ (DB4S) is a high quality, visual, open source tool to create, design, and edit database files compatible with SQLite. DB4S is for users and developers who want to create, search, and edit databases.  DB4S uses a familiar spreadsheet-like interface, so complicated SQL commands do not have to be learned. Controls and wizards are available for users to: Create and compact database files Create, define, modify and delete tables Create, define, and delete indexes Browse, edit, add, and delete records Search records Import and export records as text Import and export tables from/to CSV files Import and export databases from/to SQL dump files Issue SQL queries and inspect the results Examine a log of all SQL commands issued by the application Plot simple graphs based on table or query data"
170,19416551,2,C++,"What it is not. Even though DB4S comes with a spreadsheet-like interface, it is not meant to replace your spreadsheet application. We implement a few convenience functions which go beyond a simple database frontend but do not add them when they do not make sense in a database context or are so complex to implement that they will only ever be a poor replacement for your favorite spreadsheet application. We are a small team with limited time after all. Thanks for your understanding :)"

194,19416551,2,C++,"History. This program was developed originally by Mauricio Piacentini (@piacentini @link ) from Tabuleiro Producoes as the Arca Database Browser. The original version was used as a free companion tool to the Arca Database Xtra, a commercial product that embeds SQLite databases with some additional extensions to handle compressed and binary data. The original code was trimmed and adjusted to be compatible with standard SQLite 2.x databases. The resulting program was renamed SQLite Database Browser, and released into the Public Domain by Mauricio. Icons were contributed by Raquel Ravanini @link , also from Tabuleiro. Jens Miltner (@jmiltner @link ) contributed the code to support SQLite 3.x databases for the 1.2 release. Pete Morgan (@daffodil @link ) created an initial project on GitHub with the code in 2012, where several contributors fixed and improved pieces over the years. René Peinthor (@rp- @link ) and Martin Kleusberg (@MKleusberg @link ) then became involved, and have been the main driving force from that point.  Justin Clift (@justinclift @link ) helps out with testing on OSX, and started the new github.com/sqlitebrowser organisation on GitHub. John T. Haller @link , of PortableApps.com @link  fame, created the new logo.  He based it on the Tango icon set (public domain). In August 2014, the project was renamed to 'Database Browser for SQLite' at the request of Richard Hipp @link  (creator of SQLite @link ), as the previous name was creating unintended support issues. In September 2014, the project was renamed to 'DB Browser for SQLite', to avoid confusion with an existing application called 'Database Browser'."

The client has access to packages from two default sources. The first is 'msstore' the Microsoft Store (free Apps rated 'e' for everyone). The second is 'winget' the WinGet community repository @link . Group policy may be configured and modify configured sources. Run winget --info to see any configured policies."
198,197275130,2,C++,"Installing The Client. The client requires Windows 10 1809 (build 17763) or later at this time. Windows Server 2019 is not supported as the Microsoft Store is not available nor are updated dependencies. It may be possible to install on Windows Server 2022, this should be considered experimental (not supported), and requires dependencies to be manually installed as well."
199,197275130,3,C++,Microsoft Store Recommended. The client is distributed within the App Installer @link  package.
200,197275130,3,C++,"Development Releases. There are two methods to get development releases: Install a Windows 10 or Windows 11 Insider @link  build. Join the Windows Package Manager Insider program by signing up @link . It may take a few days to get the updated App Installer after you receive e-mail confirmation from joining the Windows Package Manager Insider program. If you decide to install the latest release from GitHub, and you have successfully joined the insider program, you will receive updates when the next development release has been published in the Microsoft Store. Once you have received the updated App Installer from the Microsoft Store you should be able to execute winget features to see experimental features. Some users have reported issues @link  with the client not being on their PATH."
201,197275130,3,C++,"Manually Update. The same Microsoft Store package will be made available via our Releases @link . Note that installing this package will give you the WinGet client, but it will not enable automatic updates from the Microsoft Store if you have not joined the Windows Package Manager Insider program. You may need to install the VC v14 Desktop Framework Package @link .. This should only be necessary on older builds of Windows 10 and only if you get an error about missing framework packages."
202,197275130,3,C++,Troubleshooting. Please read our troubleshooting guide(/doc/troubleshooting/README.md).
203,197275130,2,C++,"Administrator Considerations. Installer behavior can be different depending on whether you are running winget with administrator privileges. When running winget without administrator privileges, some applications may require elevation @link  to install. When the installer runs, Windows will prompt you to elevate @link .

Read about Marlin's decision to use a 'Hardware Abstraction Layer' below. This branch is for patches to the latest 2.1.x release version. Periodically this branch will form the basis for the next minor 2.1.x release. Download earlier versions of Marlin on the Releases page @link .
224,2200856,2,C++,"Example Configurations. Before you can build Marlin for your machine you'll need a configuration for your specific hardware. Upon request, your vendor will be happy to provide you with the complete source code and configurations for your machine, but you'll need to get updated configuration files if you want to install a newer version of Marlin. Fortunately, Marlin users have contributed dozens of tested configurations to get you started. Visit the MarlinFirmware/Configurations @link  repository to find the right configuration for your hardware."
225,2200856,2,C++,"Building Marlin 2.1.

Marlin is optimized to build with the PlatformIO IDE extension for Visual Studio Code. You can still build Marlin with Arduino IDE, and we hope to improve the Arduino build experience, but at this time PlatformIO is the better choice."

Plus, those old AVR-based machines are often the best for your testing and feedback!"
227,2200856,2,C++,"Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL). Marlin includes an abstraction layer to provide a common API for all the platforms it targets. This allows Marlin code to address the details of motion and user interface tasks at the lowest and highest levels with no system overhead, tying all events directly to the hardware clock. Every new HAL opens up a world of hardware. At this time we need HALs for RP2040 and the Duet3D family of boards. A HAL that wraps an RTOS is an interesting concept that could be explored.

236,22394357,2,C++,"What is osquery?. osquery exposes an operating system as a high-performance relational database.  This allows you to write SQL-based queries to explore operating system data.  With osquery, SQL tables represent abstract concepts such as running processes, loaded kernel modules, open network connections, browser plugins, hardware events or file hashes. SQL tables are implemented via a simple plugin and extensions API. A variety of tables already exist and more are being written:  @link @link . To best understand the expressiveness that is afforded to you by osquery, consider the following SQL queries: List the users @link :. @Code Check the processes @link  that have a deleted executable:. @Code Get the process name, port, and PID, for processes listening on all interfaces: @Code Find every macOS LaunchDaemon that launches an executable and keeps it running: @Code Check for ARP anomalies from the host's perspective: @Code Alternatively, you could also use a SQL sub-query to accomplish the same result: @Code These queries can be: - performed on an ad-hoc basis to explore operating system state using the osqueryi @link  shell - executed via a scheduler @link to monitor operating system state across a set of hosts - launched from custom applications using osquery Thrift APIs"

We use a simple numbered versioning scheme X.Y.Z, where X is a major version, Y is a minor, and Z is a patch. We plan minor releases roughly every two months. These releases are tracked on our Milestones @link  page. A patch release is used when there are unforeseen bugs with our minor release and we need to quickly patch. A rare 'revision' release might be used if we need to change build configurations. Major, minor, and patch releases are tagged on GitHub and can be viewed on the Releases @link  page. We open a new Release Checklist @link  issue when we prepare a minor release. If you are interested in the status of a release, please find the corresponding checklist issue, and note that the issue will be marked closed when we are finished the checklist. We consider a release 'in testing' during the period of hosting new downloads on our website and adding them to our hosted repositories.

267,23405758,1,C++,"Performance. Here is a performance report (with explanations) from the run of the included db_bench program.  The results are somewhat noisy, but should be enough to get a ballpark performance estimate."
268,23405758,2,C++,"Setup. We use a database with a million entries.  Each entry has a 16 byte key, and a 100 byte value.  Values used by the benchmark compress to about half their original size. LevelDB:    version 1.1 Date:       Sun May  1 12:11:26 2011 CPU:        4 x Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Quad CPU    Q6600  @ 2.40GHz CPUCache:   4096 KB Keys:       16 bytes each Values:     100 bytes each (50 bytes after compression) Entries:    1000000 Raw Size:   110.6 MB (estimated) File Size:  62.9 MB (estimated)"
269,23405758,2,C++,"Write performance. The 'fill' benchmarks create a brand new database, in either sequential, or random order.  The 'fillsync' benchmark flushes data from the operating system to the disk after every operation; the other write operations leave the data sitting in the operating system buffer cache for a while.  The 'overwrite' benchmark does random writes that update existing keys in the database. fillseq      :       1.765 micros/op;   62.7 MB/s fillsync     :     268.409 micros/op;    0.4 MB/s (10000 ops) fillrandom   :       2.460 micros/op;   45.0 MB/s overwrite    :       2.380 micros/op;   46.5 MB/s Each 'op' above corresponds to a write of a single key/value pair. I.e., a random write benchmark goes at approximately 400,000 writes per second. Each 'fillsync' operation costs much less (0.3 millisecond) than a disk seek (typically 10 milliseconds).  We suspect that this is because the hard disk itself is buffering the update in its memory and responding before the data has been written to the platter.  This may or may not be safe based on whether or not the hard disk has enough power to save its memory in the event of a power failure."
270,23405758,2,C++,"Read performance. We list the performance of reading sequentially in both the forward and reverse direction, and also the performance of a random lookup. Note that the database created by the benchmark is quite small. Therefore the report characterizes the performance of leveldb when the working set fits in memory.  The cost of reading a piece of data that is not present in the operating system buffer cache will be dominated by the one or two disk seeks needed to fetch the data from disk. Write performance will be mostly unaffected by whether or not the working set fits in memory. readrandom  : 16.677 micros/op;  (approximately 60,000 reads per second) readseq     :  0.476 micros/op;  232.3 MB/s readreverse :  0.724 micros/op;  152.9 MB/s LevelDB compacts its underlying storage data in the background to improve read performance.  The results listed above were done immediately after a lot of random writes.  The results after compactions (which are usually triggered automatically) are better. readrandom  : 11.602 micros/op;  (approximately 85,000 reads per second) readseq     :  0.423 micros/op;  261.8 MB/s readreverse :  0.663 micros/op;  166.9 MB/s Some of the high cost of reads comes from repeated decompression of blocks read from disk.  If we supply enough cache to the leveldb so it can hold the uncompressed blocks in memory, the read performance improves again: readrandom  : 9.775 micros/op;  (approximately 100,000 reads per second before compaction) readrandom  : 5.215 micros/op;  (approximately 190,000 reads per second after compaction)"

275,259463685,2,C++,"Why build Carbon?. C remains the dominant programming language for performance-critical software, with massive and growing codebases and investments. However, it is struggling to improve and meet developers' needs, as outlined above, in no small part due to accumulating decades of technical debt. Incrementally improving C is extremely difficult(/docs/project/difficulties_improving_cpp.md), both due to the technical debt itself and challenges with its evolution process. The best way to address these problems is to avoid inheriting the legacy of C or C directly, and instead start with solid language foundations like modern generics system(generics), modular code organization, and consistent,. simple syntax. Existing modern languages already provide an excellent developer experience: Go, Swift, Kotlin, Rust, and many more. Developers that _can_ use one of these existing languages _should_. Unfortunately, the designs of these languages present significant barriers to adoption and migration from C. These barriers range from changes in the idiomatic design of software to performance overhead. Carbon is fundamentally a successor language approach, rather than an attempt to incrementally evolve C. It is designed around interoperability with C as well as large-scale adoption and migration for existing C codebases and developers. A successor language for C requires: -   Performance matching C, an essential property for our developers. -   Seamless, bidirectional interoperability with C, such that a library anywhere in an existing C stack can adopt Carbon without porting the rest. -   A gentle learning curve with reasonable familiarity for C developers. -   Comparable expressivity and support for existing software's design and architecture. -   Scalable migration, with some level of source-to-source translation for idiomatic C code. With this approach, we can build on top of C's existing ecosystem, and bring along existing investments, codebases, and developer populations. There are a few languages that have followed this model for other ecosystems, and Carbon aims to fill an analogous role for C: -   JavaScript  TypeScript -   Java  Kotlin -   C  _Carbon_"
276,259463685,2,C++,"Language Goals. We are designing Carbon to support: -   Performance-critical software -   Software and language evolution -   Code that is easy to read, understand, and write -   Practical safety and testing mechanisms -   Fast and scalable development -   Modern OS platforms, hardware architectures, and environments -   Interoperability with and migration from existing C code While many languages share subsets of these goals, what distinguishes Carbon is their combination. We also have explicit _non-goals_ for Carbon, notably including: -   A stable application binary interface @link (ABI) for the entire language and library -   Perfect backwards or forwards compatibility Our detailed goals(/docs/project/goals.md) document fleshes out these ideas and provides a deeper view into our goals for the Carbon project and language."
277,259463685,2,C++,"Project status. Carbon Language is currently an experimental project. There is no working compiler or toolchain. You can see the demo interpreter for Carbon on compiler-explorer.com @link . We want to better understand whether we can build a language that meets our successor language criteria, and whether the resulting language can gather a critical mass of interest within the larger C industry and community. Currently, we have fleshed out several core aspects of both Carbon the project and the language: -   The strategy of the Carbon Language and project. -   An open-source project structure, governance model, and evolution process. -   Critical and foundational aspects of the language design informed by our experience with C and the most difficult challenges we anticipate. This includes designs for: -   Generics -   Class types -   Inheritance -   Operator overloading -   Lexical and syntactic structure -   Code organization and modular structure -   A prototype interpreter demo that can both run isolated examples and gives a detailed analysis of the specific semantic model and abstract machine of Carbon. We call this the Carbon Explorer(/explorer/). -   An under-development compiler and toolchain(/toolchain/) that will compile Carbon (and eventually C code as well) into standard executable code. This is where most of our current implementation efforts are directed. If you're interested in contributing, we're currently focused on developing the Carbon toolchain until it can support Carbon  C interop(/docs/project/roadmap.mdobjective-for-2024-a-working-toolchain-that-supports-c-interop).. Beyond that, we plan to continue developing the design and toolchain until we can ship the 0.1 language(/docs/project/milestones.mdmilestone-01-a-minimum-viable-product-mvp-for-evaluation). and support evaluating Carbon in more detail. You can see our full roadmap(/docs/project/roadmap.md) for more details."
278,259463685,2,C++,"Carbon and C. If you're already a C developer, Carbon should have a gentle learning curve. It is built out of a consistent set of language constructs that should feel familiar and be easy to read and understand. C code like this: . corresponds to this Carbon code: . You can call Carbon from C without overhead and the other way around. This means you migrate a single C library to Carbon within an application, or write new Carbon on top of your existing C investment. For example: . Read more about C interop in Carbon(/docs/design/interoperability/philosophy_and_goals.md). Beyond interoperability between Carbon and C, we're also planning to support migration tools that will mechanically translate idiomatic C code into Carbon code to help you switch an existing C codebase to Carbon."
279,259463685,2,C++,"Generics. Carbon provides a modern generics system(/docs/design/generics/overview.mdwhat-are-generics). with checked definitions, while still supporting opt-in templates(/docs/design/templates.md) for seamless C interop. Checked generics provide several advantages compared to C templates: -   Generic definitions are fully type-checked, removing the need to instantiate to check for errors and giving greater confidence in code. -   Avoids the compile-time cost of re-checking the definition for every instantiation. -   When using a definition-checked generic, usage error messages are clearer, directly showing which requirements are not met. -   Enables automatic, opt-in type erasure and dynamic dispatch without a separate implementation. This can reduce the binary size and enables constructs like heterogeneous containers. -   Strong, checked interfaces mean fewer accidental dependencies on implementation details and a clearer contract for consumers. Without sacrificing these advantages, Carbon generics support specialization, ensuring it can fully address performance-critical use cases of C templates. For more details about Carbon's generics, see their design(/docs/design/generics). In addition to easy and powerful interop with C, Carbon templates can be constrained and incrementally migrated to checked generics at a fine granularity and with a smooth evolutionary path."
280,259463685,2,C++,"Memory safety. Safety, and especially memory safety @link , remains a key challenge for C and something a successor language needs to address. Our initial priority and focus is on immediately addressing important, low-hanging fruit in the safety space: -   Tracking uninitialized states better, increased enforcement of initialization, and systematically providing hardening against initialization bugs when desired. -   Designing fundamental APIs and idioms to support dynamic bounds checks in debug and hardened builds. -   Having a default debug build mode that is both cheaper and more comprehensive than existing C build modes even when combined with Address Sanitizer @link . Once we can migrate code into Carbon, we will have a simplified language with room in the design space to add any necessary annotations or features, and infrastructure like generics(generics) to support safer design patterns.. Longer term, we will build on this to introduce a safe Carbon subset. This will be a large and complex undertaking, and won't be in the 0.1 design. Meanwhile, we are closely watching and learning from efforts to add memory safe semantics onto C such as Rust-inspired lifetime annotations @link ."

Because Carbon is an early, experimental project we don't yet have releases you can download and try out locally, you'll instead need to build any tools yourself from source. We expect to have packaged releases you can try out when we reach our 0.1 milestone(/docs/project/milestones.mdmilestone-01-a-minimum-viable-product-mvp-for-evaluation)..

For example, if the last release were 7.7.3, the new one would be 8.0.0. If any of those changes enable clients to update their code to take advantage of new functionality, and if clients would have to roll-back these changes in the event that the release was marked as 'bad', we publish a minor release. For example, we'd go from 7.7.3 to 7.8.0. Otherwise, including when a release contains only metadata(FAQ.mdmetadata_definition) changes, we publish a sub-minor release,. e.g. 7.7.3 to 7.7.4.

Just change the code in the editor and rerun the script (use the terminal's history) to see updated images."
332,29397594,2,C++,"The main idea. My source code is irrelevant. Read the wiki and implement your own renderer. Only when you suffer through all the tiny details you will learn what is going on. In this series of articles @link , I want to show the way OpenGL works by writing its clone (a much simplified one). Surprisingly enough, I often meet people who cannot overcome the initial hurdle of learning OpenGL / DirectX. Thus, I have prepared a short series of lectures, after which my students show quite good renderers. So, the task is formulated as follows: using no third-party libraries (especially graphic ones), get something like this picture: ! @link _Warning: this is a training material that will loosely repeat the structure of the OpenGL library. It will be a software renderer. I do not want to show how to write applications for OpenGL. I want to show how OpenGL works. I am deeply convinced that it is impossible to write efficient applications using 3D libraries without understanding this._ I will try to make the final code about 500 lines. My students need 10 to 20 programming hours to begin making such renderers. At the input, we get a test file with a polygonal wire  pictures with textures. At the output, we’ll get a rendered model. No graphical interface, the program simply generates an image. Since the goal is to minimize external dependencies, I give my students just one class that allows working with TGA @link  files. It’s one of the simplest formats that supports images in RGB/RGBA/black and white formats. So, as a starting point, we’ll obtain a simple way to work with pictures. You should note that the only functionality available at the very beginning (in addition to loading and saving images) is the capability to set the color of one pixel. There are no functions for drawing line segments and triangles. We’ll have to do all of this by hand. I provide my source code that I write in parallel with students. But I would not recommend using it, as this doesn’t make sense. The entire code is available on github, and here @link  you will find the source code I give to my students. @Code output.tga should look something like this: ! @link"

338,311683390,2,C++,"Requirements. To use ImHex, the following minimal system requirements need to be met. ImHex requires a GPU with OpenGL 3.0 support in general. There are releases available (with the -NoGPU suffix) that are software rendered and don't require a GPU, however these can be a lot slower than the GPU accelerated versions. If possible at all, make ImHex use the dedicated GPU on your system instead of the integrated one (especially Intel HD GPUs are known to cause issues). - OS: - Windows: Windows 7 or higher (Windows 10/11 recommended) - macOS: macOS 11 (Big Sur) or higher, - Linux: 'Modern' Linux. The following distributions have official releases available. Other distros are supported through the AppImage and Flatpak releases. - Ubuntu 22.04/23.04 - Fedora 36/37 - RHEL/AlmaLinux 9 - Arch Linux - CPU: x86_64 (64 Bit) - GPU: OpenGL 3.0 or higher - Intel HD drivers are really buggy and often cause graphic artifacts - In case you don't have a GPU available, there are software rendered releases available for Windows and macOS - RAM: 256MB, more may be required for more complicated analysis - Storage: 100MB"

388,365005377,3,C++,"Optional Dependencies (Needed for GPU monitoring). GPU monitoring also requires a btop binary built with GPU support (GPU_SUPPORTtrue flag). See GPU compatibility(gpu-compatibility) section for more about compiling with GPU support.. NVIDIA If you have an NVIDIA GPU you must use an official NVIDIA driver, both the closed-source and open-source ones have been verified to work. In addition to that you must also have the nvidia-ml dynamic library installed, which should be included with the driver package of your distribution. AMD If you have an AMD GPU rocm_smi_lib is required, which may or may not be packaged for your distribution."
389,365005377,3,C++,"Notice (Text rendering issues). If you are having problems with the characters in the graphs not looking like they do in the screenshots, it's likely a problem with your systems configured fallback font not having support for braille characters. See Terminess Powerline @link  for an example of a font that includes the braille symbols. See comments by @sgleizes link @link  and @XenHat link @link  in issue 100 for possible solutions.. If text are misaligned and you are using Konsole or Yakuake, turning off 'Bi-Directional text rendering' is a possible fix. Characters clipping in to each other or text/border misalignments is not bugs caused by btop, but most likely a fontconfig or terminal problem where the braille characters making up the graphs aren't rendered correctly. Look to the creators of the terminal emulator you use to fix these issues if the previous mentioned fixes don't work for you."

A few miscellaneous notes in the meantime: - There's limited space inside the LCD mount for wiring, and 8 wires need to fit through the hole in the center. I used 30 AWG wire-wrapping wire. Enamel-coated wire would probably work too. - Older versions of the design (as seen in the videos) used glued-on BF350-3AA strain gauges to detect presses; in v0.5 these were replaced with footprints for SMD resistors, which exhibit similar properties when stretched/compressed and are much easier to assemble. - The TMC6300 is _tiny_ and has a bottom pad, so I would seriously consider getting a stencil along with the PCB order. Even with the stencil I needed to manually clean up some bridging afterward; I _highly_ recommend Chip Quik NC191 gel flux, available on Amazon @link  (or use this non-affiliate link @link  instead) or from your electronics distributor of choice. Flux is also very helpful when soldering the LCD ribbon cable to to screen PCB. - For breadboard prototyping, the TMC6300-BOB @link  or SparkFun's TMC6300 driver board @link  are awesome and way easier to work with than the bare chip if you just want to play around with low current BLDC motors - For AliExpress purchases: I highly recommend only using AliExpress Standard Shipping (purchasing in the US). I have had multiple purchases take months or never get delivered when purchased with Cainiao or other low cost shipping options, whereas AliExpress Standard is very reliable and generally faster in my experience. - Make sure to check the open issues @link  - this design is not yet 'stable', so beware that everything may not go smoothly. Future plans: - consider switch to using an ESP32-S3-MINI-1 module - get wifi configured and working (probably MQTT?). Currently memory is an issue with the full display framebuffer sprite. PSRAM might fix this (requires newer ESP-IDF & unreleased Arduino core, and from a brief test I got horrible performance with PSRAM enabled), or the next item might help reduce memory: - migrate to LVGL, for better display rendering and easy support for menus, etc. Shouldn't require a full 240x240x24b framebuffer in memory, freeing some for wifi, etc. - Home Assistant integration, or other real-world applications - ??? - Profit @link"

If you are ordering a stencil for solder paste from JLCPCB and plan to apply paste by hand (as shown in the video @link ) without a stencil frame/machine, make sure to select 'Customized size' and enter smaller dimensions (e.g. 100mm x 100mm) to avoid getting a much larger stencil than you need. This will also likely reduce the cost of shipping substantially! Also, select only the Top side; the bottom only has 2 SMT components - the motor connector and VEML7700 ALS - so it's not worth getting a stencil for that.

521,44838949,1,C++,Swift Programming Language. Cross-Compilation Targets Swift Community-Hosted CI Platforms
522,44838949,2,C++,"Welcome to Swift. Swift is a high-performance system programming language.  It has a clean and modern syntax, offers seamless access to existing C and Objective-C code and frameworks, and is memory-safe by default. Although inspired by Objective-C and many other languages, Swift is not itself a C-derived language. As a complete and independent language, Swift packages core features like flow control, data structures, and functions, with high-level constructs like objects, protocols, closures, and generics. Swift embraces modules, eliminating the need for headers and the code duplication they entail. To learn more about the programming language, visit swift.org @link . - Contributing to Swift(contributing-to-swift). - Getting Started(getting-started). - Swift Toolchains(swift-toolchains). - Build Failures(build-failures). - Learning More(learning-more)."

To be a truly great community, Swift.org @link  needs to welcome developers from all walks of life, with different backgrounds, and with a wide range of experience. A diverse and friendly community will have more great ideas, more unique perspectives, and produce more great code. We will work diligently to make the Swift community welcoming to everyone.

525,44838949,4,C++,"Building. Swift toolchains are created using the script build-toolchain @link . This script is used by swift.org's CI to produce snapshots and can allow for one to locally reproduce such builds for development or distribution purposes. A typical invocation looks like the following: @Code where $BUNDLE_PREFIX is a string that will be prepended to the build date to give the bundle identifier of the toolchain's Info.plist. For instance, if $BUNDLE_PREFIX was com.example, the toolchain produced will have the bundle identifier com.example.YYYYMMDD. It will be created in the directory you run the script with a filename of the form: swift-LOCAL-YYYY-MM-DD-a-osx.tar.gz. Beyond building the toolchain, build-toolchain also supports the following (non-exhaustive) set of useful options: - --dry-run: Perform a dry run build. This is off by default. - --test: Test the toolchain after it has been compiled. This is off by default. - --distcc: Use distcc to speed up the build by distributing the C part of the swift build. This is off by default. - --sccache: Use sccache to speed up subsequent builds of the compiler by caching more C build artifacts. This is off by default. More options may be added over time. Please pass --help to build-toolchain to see the full set of options."

529,4524181,1,C++,"What is folly?. Folly (acronymed loosely after Facebook Open Source Library) is a library of C17 components designed with practicality and efficiency in mind. Folly contains a variety of core library components used extensively at Facebook. In particular, it's often a dependency of Facebook's other open source C efforts and place where those projects can share code. It complements (as opposed to competing against) offerings such as Boost and of course std. In fact, we embark on defining our own component only when something we need is either not available, or does not meet the needed performance profile. We endeavor to remove things from folly if or when std or Boost obsoletes them. Performance concerns permeate much of Folly, sometimes leading to designs that are more idiosyncratic than they would otherwise be (see e.g. PackedSyncPtr.h, SmallLocks.h). Good performance at large scale is a unifying theme in all of Folly."
530,4524181,2,C++,Check it out in the intro video. @link
531,4524181,1,C++,"Logical Design. Folly is a collection of relatively independent components, some as simple as a few symbols. There is no restriction on internal dependencies, meaning that a given folly module may use any other folly components. All symbols are defined in the top-level namespace folly, except of course macros. Macro names are ALL_UPPERCASE and should be prefixed with FOLLY_. Namespace folly defines other internal namespaces such as internal or detail. User code should not depend on symbols in those namespaces. Folly has an experimental directory as well. This designation connotes primarily that we feel the API may change heavily over time. This code, typically, is still in heavy use and is well tested."
532,4524181,1,C++,"Physical Design. At the top level Folly uses the classic 'stuttering' scheme folly/folly used by Boost and others. The first directory serves as an installation root of the library (with possible versioning a la folly-1.0/), and the second is to distinguish the library when including files, e.g. .. The directory structure is flat (mimicking the namespace structure), i.e. we don't have an elaborate directory hierarchy (it is possible this will change in future versions). The subdirectory experimental contains files that are used inside folly and possibly at Facebook but not considered stable enough for client use. Your code should not use files in folly/experimental lest it may break when you update Folly. The folly/folly/test subdirectory includes the unittests for all components, usually named ComponentXyzTest.cpp for each ComponentXyz.. The folly/folly/docs directory contains documentation."
533,4524181,1,C++,"What's in it?. Because of folly's fairly flat structure, the best way to see what's in it is to look at the headers in top level folly/ directory @link . You can also check the docs folder(folly/docs) for documentation, starting with the overview(folly/docs/Overview.md). Folly is published on GitHub at  @link"
534,4524181,1,C++,"Build Notes. Because folly does not provide any ABI compatibility guarantees from commit to commit, we generally recommend building folly as a static library. folly supports gcc (5.1), clang, or MSVC. It should run on Linux (x86-32, x86-64, and ARM), iOS, macOS, and Windows (x86-64). The CMake build is only tested on some of these platforms; at a minimum, we aim to support macOS and Linux (on the latest Ubuntu LTS release or newer.)"
535,4524181,2,C++,"getdeps.py. This script is used by many of Meta's OSS tools.  It will download and build all of the necessary dependencies first, and will then invoke cmake etc to build folly.  This will help ensure that you build with relevant versions of all of the dependent libraries, taking into account what versions are installed locally on your system. It's written in python so you'll need python3.6 or later on your PATH.  It works on Linux, macOS and Windows. The settings for folly's cmake build are held in its getdeps manifest build/fbcode_builder/manifests/folly, which you can edit locally if desired."
536,4524181,3,C++,Dependencies. If on Linux or MacOS (with homebrew installed) you can install system dependencies to save building them:
537,4524181,1,C++,Clone the repo. git clone  @link      Install dependencies. cd folly sudo ./build/fbcode_builder/getdeps.py install-system-deps --recursive If you'd like to see the packages before installing them: ./build/fbcode_builder/getdeps.py install-system-deps --dry-run --recursive On other platforms or if on Linux and without system dependencies getdeps.py will mostly download and build them for you during the build step. Some of the dependencies getdeps.py uses and installs are: a version of boost compiled with C14 support. googletest is required to build and run folly's tests.

You can find the default scratch install location from logs or with python3 ./build/fbcode_builder/getdeps.py show-inst-dir. There are also --install-dir and --install-prefix arguments to provide some more fine-grained control of the installation directories. However, given that folly provides no compatibility guarantees between commits we generally recommend building and installing the libraries to a temporary location, and then pointing your project's build at this temporary location, rather than installing folly in the traditional system installation directories. e.g., if you are building with CMake you can use the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH variable to allow CMake to find folly in this temporary installation directory when building your project. If you want to invoke cmake again to iterate, there is a helpful run_cmake.py script output in the scratch build directory.  You can find the scratch build directory from logs or with python3 ./build/fbcode_builder/getdeps.py show-build-dir."
541,4524181,3,C++,Run tests. By default getdeps.py will build the tests for folly. To run them: cd folly python3 ./build/fbcode_builder/getdeps.py --allow-system-packages test

544,4524181,3,C++,"Finding dependencies in non-default locations. If you have boost, gtest, or other dependencies installed in a non-default location, you can use the CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH and CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH variables to make CMAKE look also look for header files and libraries in non-standard locations.  For example, to also search the directories /alt/include/path1 and /alt/include/path2 for header files and the directories /alt/lib/path1 and /alt/lib/path2 for libraries, you can invoke cmake as follows: @Code"

You could probably make it work on most recent Ubuntu/Debian or Fedora/Redhat derived distributions. At time of writing (Dec 2021) there is a build break on GCC 11.x based systems in lang_badge_test.

563,46918116,2,C++,"Disclaimer. Dear community, With our ongoing contributions to ONNX and the ONNX Runtime, we have made it easier to interoperate within the AI framework ecosystem and to access high performance, cross-platform inferencing capabilities for both traditional ML models and deep neural networks. Over the last few years we have been privileged to develop such key open-source machine learning projects, including the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, which has enabled its users to leverage industry-wide advancements in deep learning at scale. Today’s 2.7 release will be the last main release of CNTK. We may have some subsequent minor releases for bug fixes, but these will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. There are no plans for new feature development post this release. The CNTK 2.7 release has full support for ONNX 1.4.1, and we encourage those seeking to operationalize their CNTK models to take advantage of ONNX and the ONNX Runtime. Moving forward, users can continue to leverage evolving ONNX innovations via the number of frameworks that support it. For example, users can natively export ONNX models from PyTorch or convert TensorFlow models to ONNX with the TensorFlow-ONNX converter. We are incredibly grateful for all the support we have received from contributors and users over the years since the initial open-source release of CNTK. CNTK has enabled both Microsoft teams and external users to execute complex and large-scale workloads in all manner of deep learning applications, such as historical breakthroughs in speech recognition achieved by Microsoft Speech researchers, the originators of the framework. As ONNX is increasingly employed in serving models used across Microsoft products such as Bing and Office, we are dedicated to synthesizing innovations from research with the rigorous demands of production to progress the ecosystem forward. Above all, our goal is to make innovations in deep learning across the software and hardware stacks as open and accessible as possible. We will be working hard to bring both the existing strengths of CNTK and new state-of-the-art research into other open-source projects to truly broaden the reach of such technologies. With gratitude, -- The CNTK Team"

571,46918116,3,C++,Project changelog. 2018-09-17. CNTK 2.6.0
572,46918116,2,C++,"Efficient group convolution. The implementation of group convolution in CNTK has been updated. The updated implementation moves away from creating a sub-graph for group convolution (using slicing and splicing), and instead uses cuDNN7 and MKL2017 APIs directly. This improves the experience both in terms of performance and model size. As an example, for a single group convolution op with the following attributes: - Input tensor (C, H, W)  (32, 128, 128) - Number of output channels  32 (channel multiplier is 1) - Groups  32 (depth wise convolution) - Kernel size  (5, 5) The comparison numbers for this single node are as follows:"
573,46918116,2,C++,"Sequential Convolution. The implementation of sequential convolution in CNTK has been updated. The updated implementation creates a separate sequential convolution layer. Different from regular convolution layer, this operation convolves also on the dynamic axis(sequence), and filter_shape0 is applied to that axis. The updated implementation supports broader cases, such as where stride  1 for the sequence axis. For example, a sequential convolution over a batch of one-channel black-and-white images. The images have the same fixed height of 640, but each with width of variable lengths. The width is then represented by sequential axis. Padding is enabled, and strides for both width and height are 2. f  SequentialConvolution((3,3), reduction_rank0, padTrue, strides(2,2), activationC.relu) x  C.input_variable(SequenceTensor640) x.shape (640,) h  f(x) h.shape (320,) f.W.shape (1, 1, 3, 3)"
574,46918116,3,C++,"depth_to_space and space_to_depth. There is a breaking change in the depth_to_space and space_to_depth operators. These have been updated to match ONNX specification, specifically the permutation for how the depth dimension is placed as blocks in the spatial dimensions, and vice-versa, has been changed. Please refer to the updated doc examples for these two ops to see the change."
575,46918116,3,C++,Tan and Atan. Added support for trigonometric ops Tan and Atan.
576,46918116,3,C++,ELU. Added support for alpha attribute in ELU op.
577,46918116,3,C++,"Convolution. Updated auto padding algorithms of Convolution to produce symmetric padding at best effort on CPU, without affecting the final convolution output values. This update increases the range of cases that could be covered by MKL API and improves the performance, E.g. ResNet50."
578,46918116,2,C++,"Default arguments order. There is a breaking change in the arguments property in CNTK python API. The default behavior has been updated to return arguments in python order instead of in C order. This way it will return arguments in the same order as they are fed into ops. If you wish to still get arguments in C order, you can simply override the global option. This change should only affect the following ops: Times, TransposeTimes, and Gemm(internal)."
579,46918116,2,C++,Bug fixes. - Updated doc for Convolution layer to include group and dilation arguments. - Added improved input validation for group convolution. - Updated LogSoftMax to use more numerically stable implementation. - Fixed Gather op's incorrect gradient value. - Added validation for 'None' node in python clone substitution. - Added validation for padding channel axis in convolution. - Added CNTK native default lotusIR logger to fix the 'Attempt to use DefaultLogger' error when loading some ONNX models. - Added proper initialization for ONNX TypeStrToProtoMap. - Updated python doctest to handle different print format for newer version numpy(version  1.14). - Fixed Pooling(CPU) to produce correct output values when kernel center is on padded input cells.
580,46918116,3,C++,"Updates. - Updated CNTK's ONNX import/export to use ONNX 1.2 spec. - Major update to how batch and sequence axes are handled in export and import. As a result, the complex scenarios and edge cases are handled accurately. - Updated CNTK's ONNX BatchNormalization op export/import to latest spec. - Added model domain to ONNX model export. - Improved error reporting during import and export of ONNX models. - Updated DepthToSpace and SpaceToDepth ops to match ONNX spec on the permutation for how the depth dimension is placed as block dimension. - Added support for exporting alpha attribute in ELU ONNX op. - Major overhaul to Convolution and Pooling export. Unlike before, these ops do not export an explicit Pad op in any situation. - Major overhaul to ConvolutionTranspose export and import. Attributes such as output_shape, output_padding, and pads are fully supported. - Added support for CNTK's StopGradient as a no-op. - Added ONNX support for TopK op. - Added ONNX support for sequence ops: sequence.slice, sequence.first, sequence.last, sequence.reduce_sum, sequence.reduce_max, sequence.softmax. For these ops, there is no need to expand ONNX spec. CNTK ONNX exporter just builds computation equivalent graphs for these sequence ops. - Added full support for Softmax op. - Made CNTK broadcast ops compatible with ONNX specification. - Handle to_batch, to_sequence, unpack_batch, sequence.unpack ops in CNTK ONNX exporter. - ONNX tests to export ONNX test cases for other toolkits to run and to validate. - Fixed Hardmax/Softmax/LogSoftmax import/export. - Added support for Select op export. - Added import/export support for several trigonometric ops. - Updated CNTK support for ONNX MatMul op. - Updated CNTK support for ONNX Gemm op. - Updated CNTK's ONNX MeanVarianceNormalization op export/import to latest spec. - Updated CNTK's ONNX LayerNormalization op export/import to latest spec. - Updated CNTK's ONNX PRelu op export/import to latest spec. - Updated CNTK's ONNX Gather op export/import to latest spec. - Updated CNTK's ONNX ImageScaler op export/import to latest spec. - Updated CNTK's ONNX Reduce ops export/import to latest spec. - Updated CNTK's ONNX Flatten op export/import to latest spec. - Added CNTK support for ONNX Unsqueeze op."
581,46918116,3,C++,"Bug or minor fixes:. - Updated LRN op to match ONNX 1.2 spec where the size attribute has the semantics of diameter, not radius. Added validation if LRN kernel size is larger than channel size. - Updated Min/Max import implementation to handle variadic inputs. - Fixed possible file corruption when resaving on top of existing ONNX model file."
582,46918116,2,C++,".Net Support. The Cntk.Core.Managed library has officially been converted to .Net Standard and supports .Net Core and .Net Framework applications on both Windows and Linux. Starting from this release, .Net developers should be able to restore CNTK Nuget packages using new .Net SDK style project file with package management format set to PackageReference. The following C code now works on both Windows and Linux:. var weightParameterName  'weight'; var biasParameterName  'bias'; var inputName  'input'; var outputDim  2; var inputDim  3; Variable inputVariable  Variable.InputVariable(new int { inputDim }, DataType.Float, inputName); var weightParameter  new Parameter(new int { outputDim, inputDim }, DataType.Float, 1, device, weightParameterName); var biasParameter  new Parameter(new int { outputDim }, DataType.Float, 0, device, biasParameterName); Function modelFunc  CNTKLib.Times(weightParameter, inputVariable)  biasParameter; For example, simply adding an ItemGroup clause in the .csproj file of a .Net Core application is sufficient: netcoreapp2.1 x64"
583,46918116,3,C++,Bug or minor fixes:. - Fixed C string and char to native wstring and wchar UTF conversion issues on Linux.. - Fixed multibyte and wide character conversions across the codebase. - Fixed Nuget package mechanism to pack for .Net Standard. - Fixed a memory leak issue in Value class in C API where Dispose was not called upon object destruction..

Misc Added a new API find_by_uid() under cntk.logging.graph. --- 2018-02-28. CNTK supports nightly build If you prefer to use latest CNTK bits from master, use one of the CNTK nightly package. Nightly packages for Windows @link Nightly packages for Linux @link Alternatively, you can also click corresponding build badge to land to nightly build page. --- 2018-01-31. CNTK 2.4 Highlights: Moved to CUDA9, cuDNN 7 and Visual Studio 2017. Removed Python 3.4 support. Added Volta GPU and FP16 support. Better ONNX support. CPU perf improvement. More OPs. OPs top_k operation: in the forward pass it computes the top (largest) k values and corresponding indices along the specified axis. In the backward pass the gradient is scattered to the top k elements (an element not in the top k gets a zero gradient). gather operation now supports an axis argument squeeze and expand_dims operations for easily removing and adding singleton axes zeros_like and ones_like operations. In many situations you can just rely on CNTK correctly broadcasting a simple 0 or 1 but sometimes you need the actual tensor. depth_to_space: Rearranges elements in the input tensor from the depth dimension into spatial blocks. Typical use of this operation is for implementing sub-pixel convolution for some image super-resolution models. space_to_depth: Rearranges elements in the input tensor from the spatial dimensions to the depth dimension. It is largely the inverse of DepthToSpace. sum operation: Create a new Function instance that computes element-wise sum of input tensors. softsign operation: Create a new Function instance that computes the element-wise softsign of a input tensor. asinh operation: Create a new Function instance that computes the element-wise asinh of a input tensor. log_softmax operation: Create a new Function instance that computes the logsoftmax normalized values of a input tensor. hard_sigmoid operation: Create a new Function instance that computes the hard_sigmoid normalized values of a input tensor. element_and, element_not, element_or, element_xor element-wise logic operations reduce_l1 operation: Computes the L1 norm of the input tensor's element along the provided axes. reduce_l2 operation: Computes the L2 norm of the input tensor's element along the provided axes. reduce_sum_square operation: Computes the sum square of the input tensor's element along the provided axes. image_scaler operation: Alteration of image by scaling its individual values. ONNX There have been several improvements to ONNX support in CNTK. Updates Updated ONNX Reshape op to handle InferredDimension. Adding producer_name and producer_version fields to ONNX models. Handling the case when neither auto_pad nor pads atrribute is specified in ONNX Conv op. Bug fixes Fixed bug in ONNX Pooling op serialization Bug fix to create ONNX InputVariable with only one batch axis. Bug fixes and updates to implementation of ONNX Transpose op to match updated spec. Bug fixes and updates to implementation of ONNX Conv, ConvTranspose, and Pooling ops to match updated spec. Operators Group convolution Fixed bug in group convolution. Output of CNTK Convolution op will change for groups  1. More optimized implementation of group convolution is expected in the next release. Better error reporting for group convolution in Convolution layer. Halide Binary Convolution - The CNTK build can now use optional Halide @link  libraries to build Cntk.BinaryConvolution.so/dll library that can be used with the netopt module. The library contains optimized binary convolution operators that perform better than the python based binarized convolution operators.

634,612354784,2,C++,Usage. Here are the end-to-end binary build and model conversion steps for most supported models.
635,612354784,3,C++,"Build. In order to build llama.cpp you have four different options. - Using make: - On Linux or MacOS: @Code - On Windows: 1. Download the latest fortran version of w64devkit @link . 2. Extract w64devkit on your pc. 3. Run w64devkit.exe. 4. Use the cd command to reach the llama.cpp folder. 5. From here you can run: @Code - Notes: - For faster compilation, add the -j argument to run multiple jobs in parallel. For example, make -j 8 will run 8 jobs in parallel. - For faster repeated compilation, install ccache @link . - For debug builds, run make LLAMA_DEBUG1 - Using CMake: @Code Notes: - For faster compilation, add the -j argument to run multiple jobs in parallel. For example, cmake --build build --config Release -j 8 will run 8 jobs in parallel. - For faster repeated compilation, install ccache @link . - For debug builds, there are two cases: 1. Single-config generators (e.g. default  Unix Makefiles; note that they just ignore the --config flag): @Code 2. Multi-config generators (-G param set to Visual Studio, XCode...): @Code -   Using gmake (FreeBSD): 1. Install and activate DRM in FreeBSD @link 2. Add your user to video group 3. Install compilation dependencies. @Code"
636,612354784,3,C++,"Homebrew. On Mac and Linux, the homebrew package manager can be used via @Code The formula is automatically updated with new llama.cpp releases. More info:  @link"
637,612354784,3,C++,"Nix. On Mac and Linux, the Nix package manager can be used via @Code For flake enabled installs. Or @Code For non-flake enabled installs. This expression is automatically updated within the nixpkgs repo @link .."
638,612354784,4,C++,"Flox. On Mac and Linux, Flox can be used to install llama.cpp within a Flox environment via @Code Flox follows the nixpkgs build of llama.cpp."
639,612354784,3,C++,"Metal Build. On MacOS, Metal is enabled by default. Using Metal makes the computation run on the GPU. To disable the Metal build at compile time use the LLAMA_NO_METAL1 flag or the LLAMA_METALOFF cmake option. When built with Metal support, you can explicitly disable GPU inference with the --n-gpu-layersargument."
640,612354784,3,C++,"BLAS Build. Building the program with BLAS support may lead to some performance improvements in prompt processing using batch sizes higher than 32 (the default is 512). Support with CPU-only BLAS implementations doesn't affect the normal generation performance. We may see generation performance improvements with GPU-involved BLAS implementations, e.g. cuBLAS, hipBLAS. There are currently several different BLAS implementations available for build and use: -  Accelerate Framework:. This is only available on Mac PCs and it's enabled by default. You can just build using the normal instructions. -  OpenBLAS:. This provides BLAS acceleration using only the CPU. Make sure to have OpenBLAS installed on your machine. - Using make: - On Linux: @Code - On Windows: 1. Download the latest fortran version of w64devkit @link . 2. Download the latest version of OpenBLAS for Windows @link . 3. Extract w64devkit on your pc. 4. From the OpenBLAS zip that you just downloaded copy libopenblas.a, located inside the lib folder, inside w64devkit\x86_64-w64-mingw32\lib. 5. From the same OpenBLAS zip copy the content of the include folder inside w64devkit\x86_64-w64-mingw32\include. 6. Run w64devkit.exe. 7. Use the cd command to reach the llama.cpp folder. 8. From here you can run: @Code - Using CMake on Linux: @Code -  BLIS. Check BLIS.md(docs/BLIS.md) for more information. -  SYCL. SYCL is a higher-level programming model to improve programming productivity on various hardware accelerators. llama.cpp based on SYCL is used to support Intel GPU (Data Center Max series, Flex series, Arc series, Built-in GPU and iGPU). For detailed info, please refer to llama.cpp for SYCL(README-sycl.md). -  Intel oneMKL. Building through oneAPI compilers will make avx_vnni instruction set available for intel processors that do not support avx512 and avx512_vnni. Please note that this build config does not support Intel GPU. For Intel GPU support, please refer to llama.cpp for SYCL @link . - Using manual oneAPI installation: By default, LLAMA_BLAS_VENDOR is set to Generic, so if you already sourced intel environment script and assign -DLLAMA_BLASON in cmake, the mkl version of Blas will automatically been selected. Otherwise please install oneAPI and follow the below steps: @Code - Using oneAPI docker image: If you do not want to source the environment vars and install oneAPI manually, you can also build the code using intel docker container: oneAPI-basekit @link . Then, you can use the commands given above. Check Optimizing and Running LLaMA2 on Intel CPU @link  for more information. -  CUDA. This provides GPU acceleration using the CUDA cores of your Nvidia GPU. Make sure to have the CUDA toolkit installed. You can download it from your Linux distro's package manager (e.g. apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit) or from here: CUDA Toolkit @link . For Jetson user, if you have Jetson Orin, you can try this: Offical Support @link . If you are using an old model(nano/TX2), need some additional operations before compiling. - Using make: @Code - Using CMake: @Code The environment variable CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES @link  can be used to specify which GPU(s) will be used. The following compilation options are also available to tweak performance:. -  hipBLAS. This provides BLAS acceleration on HIP-supported AMD GPUs. Make sure to have ROCm installed. You can download it from your Linux distro's package manager or from here: ROCm Quick Start (Linux) @link .. - Using make: @Code - Using CMake for Linux (assuming a gfx1030-compatible AMD GPU): @Code On Linux it is also possible to use unified memory architecture (UMA) to share main memory between the CPU and integrated GPU by setting -DLLAMA_HIP_UMAON. However, this hurts performance for non-integrated GPUs (but enables working with integrated GPUs). Note that if you get the following error: @Code Try searching for a directory under HIP_PATH that contains the file oclc_abi_version_400.bc. Then, add the following to the start of the command: HIP_DEVICE_LIB_PATH, so something like: @Code - Using make (example for target gfx1030, build with 16 CPU threads): @Code - Using CMake for Windows (using x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS, and assuming a gfx1100-compatible AMD GPU): @Code Make sure that AMDGPU_TARGETS is set to the GPU arch you want to compile for. The above example uses gfx1100 that corresponds to Radeon RX 7900XTX/XT/GRE. You can find a list of targets here @link . Find your gpu version string by matching the most significant version information from rocminfo The environment variable HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES @link  can be used to specify which GPU(s) will be used.. If your GPU is not officially supported you can use the environment variable HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION set to a similar GPU, for example 10.3.0 on RDNA2 (e.g. gfx1030, gfx1031, or gfx1035) or 11.0.0 on RDNA3. The following compilation options are also available to tweak performance (yes, they refer to CUDA, not HIP, because it uses the same code as the cuBLAS version above): -  Vulkan. With docker: You don't need to install Vulkan SDK. It will be installed inside the container. @Code Without docker: Firstly, you need to make sure you have installed Vulkan SDK @link For example, on Ubuntu 22.04 (jammy), use the command below: @Code Alternatively your package manager might be able to provide the appropriate libraries. For example for Ubuntu 22.04 you can install libvulkan-dev instead. For Fedora 40, you can install vulkan-devel, glslc and glslang packages. Then, build llama.cpp using the cmake command below: @Code"
641,612354784,3,C++,"Prepare and Quantize. You can use the GGUF-my-repo @link  space on Hugging Face to quantise your model weights without any setup too. It is synced from llama.cpp main every 6 hours. To obtain the official LLaMA 2 weights please see the Obtaining and using the Facebook LLaMA 2 model section. There is also a large selection of pre-quantized gguf models available on Hugging Face.. Note: convert.py has been moved to examples/convert-legacy-llama.py and shouldn't be used for anything other than Llama/Llama2/Mistral models and their derivatives. It does not support LLaMA 3, you can use convert-hf-to-gguf.py with LLaMA 3 downloaded from Hugging Face. @Code"
642,612354784,3,C++,"Run the quantized model. @Code When running the larger models, make sure you have enough disk space to store all the intermediate files."
643,612354784,3,C++,"Running on Windows with prebuilt binaries. You will find prebuilt Windows binaries on the release page. Simply download and extract the latest zip package of choice: (e.g. llama-b1380-bin-win-avx2-x64.zip) From the unzipped folder, open a terminal/cmd window here and place a pre-converted .gguf model file. Test out the main example like so: @Code"
644,612354784,3,C++,"Memory/Disk Requirements. As the models are currently fully loaded into memory, you will need adequate disk space to save them and sufficient RAM to load them. At the moment, memory and disk requirements are the same."
645,612354784,3,C++,"Quantization. Several quantization methods are supported. They differ in the resulting model disk size and inference speed.

646,612354784,3,C++,"Perplexity (measuring model quality). You can use the perplexity example to measure perplexity over a given prompt (lower perplexity is better). For more information, see  @link @link . The perplexity measurements in table above are done against the wikitext2 test dataset  @link , with context length of 512. The time per token is measured on a MacBook M1 Pro 32GB RAM using 4 and 8 threads."

648,612354784,3,C++,"Interactive mode. If you want a more ChatGPT-like experience, you can run in interactive mode by passing -i as a parameter. In this mode, you can always interrupt generation by pressing CtrlC and entering one or more lines of text, which will be converted into tokens and appended to the current context. You can also specify a reverse prompt with the parameter -r 'reverse prompt string'. This will result in user input being prompted whenever the exact tokens of the reverse prompt string are encountered in the generation. A typical use is to use a prompt that makes LLaMA emulate a chat between multiple users, say Alice and Bob, and pass -r 'Alice:'. Here is an example of a few-shot interaction, invoked with the command @Code Note the use of --color to distinguish between user input and generated text. Other parameters are explained in more detail in the README(examples/main/README.md) for the llama-cli example program."
649,612354784,3,C++,"Persistent Interaction. The prompt, user inputs, and model generations can be saved and resumed across calls to ./llama-cli by leveraging --prompt-cache and --prompt-cache-all. The ./examples/chat-persistent.sh script demonstrates this with support for long-running, resumable chat sessions. To use this example, you must provide a file to cache the initial chat prompt and a directory to save the chat session, and may optionally provide the same variables as chat-13B.sh. The same prompt cache can be reused for new chat sessions. Note that both prompt cache and chat directory are tied to the initial prompt (PROMPT_TEMPLATE) and the model file. @Code"
650,612354784,3,C++,"Constrained output with grammars. llama.cpp supports grammars to constrain model output. For example, you can force the model to output JSON only: @Code The grammars/ folder contains a handful of sample grammars. To write your own, check out the GBNF Guide @link . For authoring more complex JSON grammars, you can also check out  @link a browser app that lets you write TypeScript interfaces which it compiles to GBNF grammars that you can save for local use. Note that the app is built and maintained by members of the community, please file any issues or FRs on its repo @link  and not this one."

654,612354784,4,C++,"Building the Project using Android NDK. Obtain the Android NDK @link  and then build with CMake. Execute the following commands on your computer to avoid downloading the NDK to your mobile. Alternatively, you can also do this in Termux: @Code Install termux @link  on your device and run termux-setup-storage to get access to your SD card (if Android 11 then run the command twice).. Finally, copy these built llama binaries and the model file to your device storage. Because the file permissions in the Android sdcard cannot be changed, you can copy the executable files to the /data/data/com.termux/files/home/bin path, and then execute the following commands in Termux to add executable permission: (Assumed that you have pushed the built executable files to the /sdcard/llama.cpp/bin path using adb push) @Code Download model llama-2-7b-chat.Q4_K_M.gguf @link , and push it to /sdcard/llama.cpp/, then move it to /data/data/com.termux/files/home/model/ @Code Now, you can start chatting: @Code Here's a demo of an interactive session running on Pixel 5 phone: @link"

659,612354784,4,C++,"Building Locally. @Code You may want to pass in some different ARGS, depending on the CUDA environment supported by your container host, as well as the GPU architecture. The defaults are: - CUDA_VERSION set to 11.7.1 - CUDA_DOCKER_ARCH set to all The resulting images, are essentially the same as the non-CUDA images: 1. local/llama.cpp:full-cuda: This image includes both the main executable file and the tools to convert LLaMA models into ggml and convert into 4-bit quantization. 2. local/llama.cpp:light-cuda: This image only includes the main executable file. 3. local/llama.cpp:server-cuda: This image only includes the server executable file."
660,612354784,4,C++,"Usage. After building locally, Usage is similar to the non-CUDA examples, but you'll need to add the --gpus flag. You will also want to use the --n-gpu-layers flag. @Code"

675,619959033,2,C++,About GPT4All. GPT4All is an ecosystem to run powerful and customized large language models that work locally on consumer grade CPUs and NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. Note that your CPU needs to support AVX instructions @link . Learn more in the documentation @link . A GPT4All model is a 3GB - 8GB file that you can download and plug into the GPT4All software. Nomic AI supports and maintains this software ecosystem to enforce quality and security alongside spearheading the effort to allow any person or enterprise to easily deploy their own on-edge large language models.
676,619959033,3,C++,"Installation. The recommended way to install GPT4All is to use one of the online installers linked above in this README, which are also available at the GPT4All website @link . These require an internet connection at install time, are slightly easier to use on macOS due to code signing, and provide a version of GPT4All that can check for updates. An alternative way to install GPT4All is to use one of the offline installers available on the Releases page @link . These do not require an internet connection at install time, and can be used to install an older version of GPT4All if so desired. But using these requires acknowledging a security warning on macOS, and they provide a version of GPT4All that is unable to notify you of updates, so you should enable notifications for Releases on this repository (Watch  Custom  Releases) or sign up for announcements in our Discord server @link ."

716,66088979,2,C++,"Purpose. The book claims to be 'On the Fly'. Its intent is to provide a comprehensive introduction to the relevant features regarding modern C (before 2020s). Readers can choose interesting content according to the following table of content to learn and quickly familiarize the new features you would like to learn. Readers should be aware that not all of these features are required. Instead, it should be learned when you really need it. At the same time, instead of coding-only, the book introduces the historical background of its technical requirements (as simple as possible), which provides great help in understanding why these features came out. In addition, the author would like to encourage readers to use modern C directly in their new projects and  migrate their old projects to modern C gradually after reading the book."
717,66088979,2,C++,"Targets. - This book assumes that readers are already familiar with traditional C (i.e. C98 or earlier), or at least that they do not have any difficulty in reading traditional C code. In other words, those who have long experience in traditional C and people who desire to quickly understand the features of modern C in a short period of time are well suited to read the book. - This book introduces, to a certain extent, the dark magic of modern C. However, these magic tricks are very limited, they are not suitable for readers who want to learn advanced C. The purpose of this book is offering a quick start for modern C. Of course, advanced readers can also use this book to review and examine themselves on modern C."

LLaVA is a new LLM that can do more than just chat; you can also upload images and ask it questions about them. With llamafile, this all happens locally; no data ever leaves your computer. 1. Download llava-v1.5-7b-q4.llamafile @link  (4.29 GB). 2. Open your computer's terminal. 3. If you're using macOS, Linux, or BSD, you'll need to grant permission for your computer to execute this new file. (You only need to do this once.) @Code 4. If you're on Windows, rename the file by adding '.exe' on the end. 5. Run the llamafile. e.g.: @Code 6. Your browser should open automatically and display a chat interface. (If it doesn't, just open your browser and point it at  @link 7. When you're done chatting, return to your terminal and hit Control-C to shut down llamafile. Having trouble? See the 'Gotchas' section below."
727,689773665,3,C++,"JSON API Quickstart. When llamafile is started, in addition to hosting a web UI chat server at , an OpenAI API @link  compatible chat completions endpoint is provided too. It's designed to support the most common OpenAI API use cases, in a way that runs entirely locally. We've also extended it to include llama.cpp specific features (e.g. mirostat) that may also be used. For further details on what fields and endpoints are available, refer to both the OpenAI documentation @link and the llamafile server README(llama.cpp/server/README.mdapi-endpoints).. Curl API Client Example The simplest way to get started using the API is to copy and paste the following curl command into your terminal. @Code The response that's printed should look like the following: @Code Python API Client example If you've already developed your software using the openai Python package @link  (that's published by OpenAI) then you should be able to port your app to talk to llamafile instead, by making a few changes to base_url and api_key. This example assumes you've run pip3 install openai to install OpenAI's client software, which is required by this example. Their package is just a simple Python wrapper around the OpenAI API interface, which can be implemented by any server. @Code The above code will return a Python object like this: @Code"
728,689773665,2,C++,"Other example llamafiles. We also provide example llamafiles for other models, so you can easily try out llamafile with different kinds of LLMs. Here is an example for the Mistral command-line llamafile: @Code And here is an example for WizardCoder-Python command-line llamafile: @Code \n' -p ' @Code And here's an example for the LLaVA command-line llamafile: @Code As before, macOS, Linux, and BSD users will need to use the 'chmod' command to grant execution permissions to the file before running these llamafiles for the first time. Unfortunately, Windows users cannot make use of many of these example llamafiles because Windows has a maximum executable file size of 4GB, and all of these examples exceed that size. (The LLaVA llamafile works on Windows because it is 30MB shy of the size limit.) But don't lose heart: llamafile allows you to use external weights; this is described later in this document. Having trouble? See the 'Gotchas' section below."
729,689773665,2,C++,"How llamafile works. A llamafile is an executable LLM that you can run on your own computer. It contains the weights for a given open LLM, as well as everything needed to actually run that model on your computer. There's nothing to install or configure (with a few caveats, discussed in subsequent sections of this document). This is all accomplished by combining llama.cpp with Cosmopolitan Libc, which provides some useful capabilities: 1. llamafiles can run on multiple CPU microarchitectures. We added runtime dispatching to llama.cpp that lets new Intel systems use modern CPU features without trading away support for older computers. 2. llamafiles can run on multiple CPU architectures. We do that by concatenating AMD64 and ARM64 builds with a shell script that launches the appropriate one. Our file format is compatible with WIN32 and most UNIX shells. It's also able to be easily converted (by either you or your users) to the platform-native format, whenever required. 3. llamafiles can run on six OSes (macOS, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD). If you make your own llama files, you'll only need to build your code once, using a Linux-style toolchain. The GCC-based compiler we provide is itself an Actually Portable Executable, so you can build your software for all six OSes from the comfort of whichever one you prefer most for development. 4. The weights for an LLM can be embedded within the llamafile. We added support for PKZIP to the GGML library. This lets uncompressed weights be mapped directly into memory, similar to a self-extracting archive. It enables quantized weights distributed online to be prefixed with a compatible version of the llama.cpp software, thereby ensuring its originally observed behaviors can be reproduced indefinitely. 5. Finally, with the tools included in this project you can create your own llamafiles, using any compatible model weights you want. You can then distribute these llamafiles to other people, who can easily make use of them regardless of what kind of computer they have."
730,689773665,2,C++,"Using llamafile with external weights. Even though our example llamafiles have the weights built-in, you don't have to use llamafile that way. Instead, you can download just the llamafile software (without any weights included) from our releases page. You can then use it alongside any external weights you may have on hand. External weights are particularly useful for Windows users because they enable you to work around Windows' 4GB executable file size limit. For Windows users, here's an example for the Mistral LLM: @Code Windows users may need to change ./llamafile.exe to .\llamafile.exe when running the above command."
731,689773665,2,C++,"Gotchas. On macOS with Apple Silicon you need to have Xcode Command Line Tools installed for llamafile to be able to bootstrap itself. If you use zsh and have trouble running llamafile, try saying sh -c ./llamafile. This is due to a bug that was fixed in zsh 5.9. The same is the case for Python subprocess, old versions of Fish, etc. On some Linux systems, you might get errors relating to run-detectors or WINE. This is due to binfmt_misc registrations. You can fix that by adding an additional registration for the APE file format llamafile uses: @Code As mentioned above, on Windows you may need to rename your llamafile by adding .exe to the filename. Also as mentioned above, Windows also has a maximum file size limit of 4GB for executables. The LLaVA server executable above is just 30MB shy of that limit, so it'll work on Windows, but with larger models like WizardCoder 13B, you need to store the weights in a separate file. An example is provided above; see 'Using llamafile with external weights.' On WSL, it's recommended that the WIN32 interop feature be disabled: @Code In the instance of getting a Permission Denied on disabling interop through CLI, it can be permanently disabled by adding the following in /etc/wsl.conf @Code On Raspberry Pi, if you get 'mmap error 12' then it means your kernel is configured with fewer than 48 bits of address space. You need to upgrade to RPI 5. You can still use RPI 4 if you either (1) rebuild your kernel, or (2) get your SDcard OS image directly from Ubuntu (don't use RPI OS). On any platform, if your llamafile process is immediately killed, check if you have CrowdStrike and then ask to be whitelisted."
732,689773665,2,C++,"Supported OSes. llamafile supports the following operating systems, which require a minimum stock install: - Linux 2.6.18 (i.e. every distro since RHEL5 c. 2007) - Darwin (macOS) 23.1.0 1 (GPU is only supported on ARM64) - Windows 8 (AMD64 only) - FreeBSD 13 - NetBSD 9.2 (AMD64 only) - OpenBSD 7 (AMD64 only) On Windows, llamafile runs as a native portable executable. On UNIX systems, llamafile extracts a small loader program named ape to $TMPDIR/.llamafile or /.ape-1.9 which is used to map your model into memory. 1 Darwin kernel versions 15.6 should be supported, but we currently have no way of testing that."
733,689773665,2,C++,"Supported CPUs. llamafile supports the following CPUs: - AMD64 microprocessors must have AVX. Otherwise llamafile will print an error and refuse to run. This means that if you have an Intel CPU, it needs to be Intel Sandybridge or newer (circa 2011), and if you have an AMD CPU, then it needs to be Bulldozer or newer (circa 2011). Support for AVX512, AVX2, FMA, F16C, and VNNI are conditionally enabled at runtime if you have a newer CPU. - ARM64 microprocessors must have ARMv8a. This means everything from Apple Silicon to 64-bit Raspberry Pis will work, provided your weights fit into memory."
734,689773665,2,C++,"GPU support. llamafile supports the following kinds of GPUs: - Apple Metal - NVIDIA - AMD GPU on MacOS ARM64 is supported by compiling a small module using the Xcode Command Line Tools, which need to be installed. This is a one time cost that happens the first time you run your llamafile. The DSO built by llamafile is stored in $TMPDIR/.llamafile or $HOME/.llamafile. Offloading to GPU is enabled by default when a Metal GPU is present. This can be disabled by passing -ngl 0 or --gpu disable to force llamafile to perform CPU inference. Owners of NVIDIA and AMD graphics cards need to pass the -ngl 999 flag to enable maximum offloading. If multiple GPUs are present then the work will be divided evenly among them by default, so you can load larger models. Multiple GPU support may be broken on AMD Radeon systems. If that happens to you, then use export HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES0 which forces llamafile to only use the first GPU. Windows users are encouraged to use our release binaries, because they contain prebuilt DLLs for both NVIDIA and AMD graphics cards, which only depend on the graphics driver being installed. If llamafile detects that NVIDIA's CUDA SDK or AMD's ROCm HIP SDK are installed, then llamafile will try to build a faster DLL that uses cuBLAS or rocBLAS. In order for llamafile to successfully build a cuBLAS module, it needs to be run on the x64 MSVC command prompt. You can use CUDA via WSL by enabling Nvidia CUDA on WSL @link and running your llamafiles inside of WSL. Using WSL has the added benefit of letting you run llamafiles greater than 4GB on Windows. On Linux, NVIDIA users will need to install the CUDA SDK (ideally using the shell script installer) and ROCm users need to install the HIP SDK. They're detected by looking to see if nvcc or hipcc are on the PATH. If you have both an AMD GPU and an NVIDIA GPU in your machine, then you may need to qualify which one you want used, by passing either --gpu amd or --gpu nvidia. In the event that GPU support couldn't be compiled and dynamically linked on the fly for any reason, llamafile will fall back to CPU inference."
735,689773665,2,C++,"Source installation. Developing on llamafile requires a modern version of the GNU make command (called gmake on some systems), sha256sum (otherwise cc will be used to build it), wget (or curl), and unzip available at @link @link . Windows users need cosmos bash @link  shell too. @Code Here's an example of how to generate code for a libc function using the llama.cpp command line interface, utilizing WizardCoder-Python-13B weights: @Code \n' \ -e -p ' @Code Here's a similar example that instead utilizes Mistral-7B-Instruct weights for prose composition: @Code Here's an example of how llamafile can be used as an interactive chatbot that lets you query knowledge contained in training data: @Code Here's an example of how you can use llamafile to summarize HTML URLs: @Code Here's how you can use llamafile to describe a jpg/png/gif/bmp image: @Code It's possible to use BNF grammar to enforce the output is predictable and safe to use in your shell script. The simplest grammar would be --grammar 'root :: 'yes' standard output either 'yes\n' or 'no\n'. Another example is if you wanted to write a script to rename all your image files, you could say: @Code Here's an example of how to run llama.cpp's built-in HTTP server. This example uses LLaVA v1.5-7B, a multimodal LLM that works with llama.cpp's recently-added support for image inputs. @Code The above command will launch a browser tab on your personal computer to display a web interface. It lets you chat with your LLM and upload images to it."
736,689773665,2,C++,"Creating llamafiles. If you want to be able to just say: @Code ...and have it run the web server without having to specify arguments, then you can embed both the weights and a special .args inside, which specifies the default arguments. First, let's create a file named .args which has this content: @Code As we can see above, there's one argument per line. The ... argument optionally specifies where any additional CLI arguments passed by the user are to be inserted. Next, we'll add both the weights and the argument file to the executable: @Code Congratulations. You've just made your own LLM executable that's easy to share with your friends."
737,689773665,2,C++,"Distribution. One good way to share a llamafile with your friends is by posting it on Hugging Face. If you do that, then it's recommended that you mention in your Hugging Face commit message what git revision or released version of llamafile you used when building your llamafile. That way everyone online will be able verify the provenance of its executable content. If you've made changes to the llama.cpp or cosmopolitan source code, then the Apache 2.0 license requires you to explain what changed. One way you can do that is by embedding a notice in your llamafile using zipalign that describes the changes, and mention it in your Hugging Face commit."
738,689773665,2,C++,"Documentation. There's a manual page for each of the llamafile programs installed when you run sudo make install. The command manuals are also typeset as PDF files that you can download from our GitHub releases page. Lastly, most commands will display that information when passing the --help flag."
739,689773665,2,C++,"Running llamafile with models downloaded by third-party applications. This section answers the question 'I already have a model downloaded locally by application X, can I use it with llamafile?'. The general answer is 'yes, as long as those models are locally stored in GGUF format' but its implementation can be more or less hacky depending on the application. A few examples (tested on a Mac) follow."
740,689773665,3,C++,"LM Studio. LM Studio @link  stores downloaded models in /.cache/lm-studio/models, in subdirectories with the same name of the models (following HuggingFace's account_name/model_name format), with the same filename you saw when you chose to download the file. So if you have downloaded e.g. the llama-2-7b.Q2_K.gguf file for TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-GGUF, you can run llamafile as follows: @Code"
741,689773665,3,C++,"Ollama. When you download a new model with ollama @link , all its metadata will be stored in a manifest file under /.ollama/models/manifests/registry.ollama.ai/library/. The directory and manifest file name are the model name as returned by ollama list. For instance, for llama3:latest the manifest file will be named .ollama/models/manifests/registry.ollama.ai/library/llama3/latest. The manifest maps each file related to the model (e.g. GGUF weights, license, prompt template, etc) to a sha256 digest. The digest corresponding to the element whose mediaType is application/vnd.ollama.image.model is the one referring to the model's GGUF file. Each sha256 digest is also used as a filename in the /.ollama/models/blobs directory (if you look into that directory you'll see only those sha256- filenames). This means you can directly run llamafile by passing the sha256 digest as the model filename. So if e.g. the llama3:latest GGUF file digest is sha256-00e1317cbf74d901080d7100f57580ba8dd8de57203072dc6f668324ba545f29, you can run llamafile as follows: @Code"
742,689773665,2,C++,"Technical details. Here is a succinct overview of the tricks we used to create the fattest executable format ever. The long story short is llamafile is a shell script that launches itself and runs inference on embedded weights in milliseconds without needing to be copied or installed. What makes that possible is mmap(). Both the llama.cpp executable and the weights are concatenated onto the shell script. A tiny loader program is then extracted by the shell script, which maps the executable into memory. The llama.cpp executable then opens the shell script again as a file, and calls mmap() again to pull the weights into memory and make them directly accessible to both the CPU and GPU."
743,689773665,3,C++,"ZIP weights embedding. The trick to embedding weights inside llama.cpp executables is to ensure the local file is aligned on a page size boundary. That way, assuming the zip file is uncompressed, once it's mmap()'d into memory we can pass pointers directly to GPUs like Apple Metal, which require that data be page size aligned. Since no existing ZIP archiving tool has an alignment flag, we had to write about 500 lines of code(llamafile/zipalign.c) to insert the ZIP files ourselves. However, once there, every existing ZIP program should be able to read them, provided they support ZIP64. This makes the weights much more easily accessible than they otherwise would have been, had we invented our own file format for concatenated files."
744,689773665,3,C++,"Microarchitectural portability. On Intel and AMD microprocessors, llama.cpp spends most of its time in the matmul quants, which are usually written thrice for SSSE3, AVX, and AVX2. llamafile pulls each of these functions out into a separate file that can be ed multiple times, with varying. __attribute__((__target__('arch'))) function attributes. Then, a wrapper function is added which uses Cosmopolitan's X86_HAVE(FOO) feature to runtime dispatch to the appropriate implementation."
745,689773665,3,C++,"Architecture portability. llamafile solves architecture portability by building llama.cpp twice: once for AMD64 and again for ARM64. It then wraps them with a shell script which has an MZ prefix. On Windows, it'll run as a native binary. On Linux, it'll extract a small 8kb executable called APE Loader @link to ${TMPDIR:-${HOME:-.}}/.ape that'll map the binary portions of the shell script into memory. It's possible to avoid this process by running the assimilate @link program that comes included with the cosmocc compiler. What the assimilate program does is turn the shell script executable into the host platform's native executable format. This guarantees a fallback path exists for traditional release processes when it's needed."
746,689773665,3,C++,"GPU support. Cosmopolitan Libc uses static linking, since that's the only way to get the same executable to run on six OSes. This presents a challenge for llama.cpp, because it's not possible to statically link GPU support. The way we solve that is by checking if a compiler is installed on the host system. For Apple, that would be Xcode, and for other platforms, that would be nvcc. llama.cpp has a single file implementation of each GPU module, named ggml-metal.m (Objective C) and ggml-cuda.cu (Nvidia C). llamafile embeds those source files within the zip archive and asks the platform compiler to build them at runtime, targeting the native GPU microarchitecture. If it works, then it's linked with platform C library dlopen() implementation. See llamafile/cuda.c(llamafile/cuda.c) and llamafile/metal.c(llamafile/metal.c). In order to use the platform-specific dlopen() function, we need to ask the platform-specific compiler to build a small executable that exposes these interfaces. On ELF platforms, Cosmopolitan Libc maps this helper executable into memory along with the platform's ELF interpreter. The platform C library then takes care of linking all the GPU libraries, and then runs the helper program which longjmp()'s back into Cosmopolitan. The executable program is now in a weird hybrid state where two separate C libraries exist which have different ABIs. For example, thread local storage works differently on each operating system, and programs will crash if the TLS register doesn't point to the appropriate memory. The way Cosmopolitan Libc solves that on AMD is by using SSE to recompile the executable at runtime to change %fs register accesses into %gs which takes a millisecond. On ARM, Cosmo uses the x28 register for TLS which can be made safe by passing the -ffixed-x28 flag when compiling GPU modules. Lastly, llamafile uses the __ms_abi__ attribute so that function pointers passed between the application and GPU modules conform to the Windows calling convention. Amazingly enough, every compiler we tested, including nvcc on Linux and even Objective-C on MacOS, all support compiling WIN32 style functions, thus ensuring your llamafile will be able to talk to Windows drivers, when it's run on Windows, without needing to be recompiled as a separate file for Windows. See cosmopolitan/dlopen.c @link for further details."
747,689773665,2,C++,"A note about models. The example llamafiles provided above should not be interpreted as endorsements or recommendations of specific models, licenses, or data sets on the part of Mozilla."
748,689773665,2,C++,"Security. llamafile adds pledge() and SECCOMP sandboxing to llama.cpp. This is enabled by default. It can be turned off by passing the --unsecure flag. Sandboxing is currently only supported on Linux and OpenBSD on systems without GPUs; on other platforms it'll simply log a warning. Our approach to security has these benefits: 1. After it starts up, your HTTP server isn't able to access the filesystem at all. This is good, since it means if someone discovers a bug in the llama.cpp server, then it's much less likely they'll be able to access sensitive information on your machine or make changes to its configuration. On Linux, we're able to sandbox things even further; the only networking related system call the HTTP server will allowed to use after starting up, is accept(). That further limits an attacker's ability to exfiltrate information, in the event that your HTTP server is compromised. 2. The main CLI command won't be able to access the network at all. This is enforced by the operating system kernel. It also won't be able to write to the file system. This keeps your computer safe in the event that a bug is ever discovered in the GGUF file format that lets an attacker craft malicious weights files and post them online. The only exception to this rule is if you pass the --prompt-cache flag without also specifying --prompt-cache-ro. In that case, security currently needs to be weakened to allow cpath and wpath access, but network access will remain forbidden. Therefore your llamafile is able to protect itself against the outside world, but that doesn't mean you're protected from llamafile. Sandboxing is self-imposed. If you obtained your llamafile from an untrusted source then its author could have simply modified it to not do that. In that case, you can run the untrusted llamafile inside another sandbox, such as a virtual machine, to make sure it behaves how you expect."

759,7056202,1,C++,"Motivation. So why yet another formatting library? There are plenty of methods for doing this task, from standard ones like the printf family of function and iostreams to Boost Format and FastFormat libraries. The reason for creating a new library is that every existing solution that I found either had serious issues or didn\'t provide all the features I needed."
760,7056202,2,C++,"printf. The good thing about printf is that it is pretty fast and readily available being a part of the C standard library. The main drawback is that it doesn\'t support user-defined types. printf also has safety issues although they are somewhat mitigated with \_\_attribute\_\_ ((format (printf, \...)) @link  in GCC. There is a POSIX extension that adds positional arguments required for i18n @link to printf but it is not a part of C99 and may not be available on some platforms."
761,7056202,2,C++,"iostreams. The main issue with iostreams is best illustrated with an example: c std::cout  Three features that have no hope of being accommodated within the current design are: - Leading zeros (or any other non-space padding) - Octal/hexadecimal encoding - Runtime width/alignment specification It is also quite big and has a heavy dependency, on STLSoft, which might be too restrictive for use in some projects."

Quickstart(quickstart) Documentation @link  Examples(examples) . @link MLX is an array framework for machine learning research on Apple silicon, brought to you by Apple machine learning research. Some key features of MLX include: - Familiar APIs: MLX has a Python API that closely follows NumPy.  MLX also has fully featured C, C @link , and Swift @link  APIs, which closely mirror the Python API.  MLX has higher-level packages like mlx.nn and mlx.optimizers with APIs that closely follow PyTorch to simplify building more complex models. - Composable function transformations: MLX supports composable function transformations for automatic differentiation, automatic vectorization, and computation graph optimization. - Lazy computation: Computations in MLX are lazy. Arrays are only materialized when needed. - Dynamic graph construction: Computation graphs in MLX are constructed dynamically. Changing the shapes of function arguments does not trigger slow compilations, and debugging is simple and intuitive. - Multi-device: Operations can run on any of the supported devices (currently the CPU and the GPU). - Unified memory: A notable difference from MLX and other frameworks is the unified memory model. Arrays in MLX live in shared memory. Operations on MLX arrays can be performed on any of the supported device types without transferring data. MLX is designed by machine learning researchers for machine learning researchers. The framework is intended to be user-friendly, but still efficient to train and deploy models. The design of the framework itself is also conceptually simple. We intend to make it easy for researchers to extend and improve MLX with the goal of quickly exploring new ideas. The design of MLX is inspired by frameworks like NumPy @link , PyTorch @link , Jax @link , and ArrayFire @link ."

780,79317191,3,C++,"How does this differ from Elasticsearch?. Elasticsearch is a large piece of software, that takes non-trivial amount of effort to setup, administer, scale and fine-tune. It offers you a few thousand configuration parameters to get to your ideal configuration. So it's better suited for large teams who have the bandwidth to get it production-ready, regularly monitor it and scale it, especially when they have a need to store billions of documents and petabytes of data (eg: logs). Typesense is built specifically for decreasing the 'time to market' for a delightful search experience. It is a light-weight yet powerful & scaleable alternative that focuses on Developer Happiness and Experience with a clean well-documented API, clear semantics and smart defaults so it just works well out-of-the-box, without you having to turn many knobs. Elasticsearch also runs on the JVM, which by itself can be quite an effort to tune to run optimally. Typesense, on the other hand, is a single light-weight self-contained native binary, so it's simple to setup and operate. See a side-by-side feature comparison here @link ."
781,79317191,3,C++,"How does this differ from Algolia?. Algolia is a proprietary, hosted, search-as-a-service product that works well, when cost is not an issue. From our experience, fast growing sites and apps quickly run into search & indexing limits, accompanied by expensive plan upgrades as they scale. Typesense on the other hand is an open-source product that you can run on your own infrastructure or use our managed SaaS offering - Typesense Cloud @link . The open source version is free to use (besides of course your own infra costs). With Typesense Cloud we do not charge by records or search operations. Instead, you get a dedicated cluster and you can throw as much data and traffic at it as it can handle. You only pay a fixed hourly cost & bandwidth charges for it, depending on the configuration your choose, similar to most modern cloud platforms. From a product perspective, Typesense is closer in spirit to Algolia than Elasticsearch. However, we've addressed some important limitations with Algolia: Algolia requires separate indices for each sort order, which counts towards your plan limits. Most of the index settings like fields to search, fields to facet, fields to group by, ranking settings, etc are defined upfront when the index is created vs being able to set them on the fly at query time. With Typesense, these settings can be configured at search time via query parameters which makes it very flexible and unlocks new use cases. Typesense is also able to give you sorted results with a single index, vs having to create multiple. This helps reduce memory consumption. Algolia offers the following features that Typesense does not have currently: personalization & server-based search analytics. For analytics, you can still instrument your search on the client-side and send search metrics to your web analytics tool of choice. We intend to bridge this gap in Typesense, but in the meantime, please let us know if any of these are a show stopper for your use case by creating a feature request in our issue tracker. See a side-by-side feature comparison here @link ."
782,79317191,3,C++,"Speed is great, but what about the memory footprint?. A fresh Typesense server will consume about 30 MB of memory. As you start indexing documents, the memory use will increase correspondingly. How much it increases depends on the number and type of fields you index. We've strived to keep the in-memory data structures lean. To give you a rough idea: when 1 million Hacker News titles are indexed along with their points, Typesense consumes 165 MB of memory. The same size of that data on disk in JSON format is 88 MB. If you have any numbers from your own datasets that we can add to this section, please send us a PR!"
783,79317191,3,C++,"Why the GPL license?. From our experience companies are generally concerned when libraries they use are GPL licensed, since library code is directly integrated into their code and will lead to derivative work and trigger GPL compliance. However, Typesense Server is server software and we expect users to typically run it as a separate daemon, and not integrate it with their own code. GPL covers and allows for this use case generously (eg: Linux is GPL licensed). Now, AGPL is what makes server software accessed over a network result in derivative work and not GPL. And for that reason we’ve opted to not use AGPL for Typesense. Now, if someone makes modifications to Typesense server, GPL actually allows you to still keep the modifications to yourself as long as you don't distribute the modified code. So a company can for example modify Typesense server and run the modified code internally and still not have to open source their modifications, as long as they make the modified code available to everyone who has access to the modified software. Now, if someone makes modifications to Typesense server and distributes the modifications, that's where GPL kicks in. Given that we’ve published our work to the community, we'd like for others' modifications to also be made open to the community in the spirit of open source. We use GPL for this purpose. Other licenses would allow our open source work to be modified, made closed source and distributed, which we want to avoid with Typesense for the project’s long term sustainability. Here's more background on why GPL, as described by Discourse:  @link Many of the points mentioned there resonate with us. Now, all of the above only apply to Typesense Server. Our client libraries are indeed meant to be integrated into our users’ code and so they use Apache license. So in summary, AGPL is what is usually problematic for server software and we’ve opted not to use it. We believe GPL for Typesense Server captures the essence of what we want for this open source project. GPL has a long history of successfully being used by popular open source projects. Our libraries are still Apache licensed. If you have specifics that prevent you from using Typesense due to a licensing issue, we're happy to explore this topic further with you.

788,81227005,1,C++,"Faiss. Faiss is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It contains algorithms that search in sets of vectors of any size, up to ones that possibly do not fit in RAM. It also contains supporting code for evaluation and parameter tuning. Faiss is written in C with complete wrappers for Python/numpy. Some of the most useful algorithms are implemented on the GPU. It is developed primarily at Meta's Fundamental AI Research @link  group."
789,81227005,2,C++,News. See CHANGELOG.md(CHANGELOG.md) for detailed information about latest features.
790,81227005,2,C++,"Introduction. Faiss contains several methods for similarity search. It assumes that the instances are represented as vectors and are identified by an integer, and that the vectors can be compared with L2 (Euclidean) distances or dot products. Vectors that are similar to a query vector are those that have the lowest L2 distance or the highest dot product with the query vector. It also supports cosine similarity, since this is a dot product on normalized vectors. Some of the methods, like those based on binary vectors and compact quantization codes, solely use a compressed representation of the vectors and do not require to keep the original vectors. This generally comes at the cost of a less precise search but these methods can scale to billions of vectors in main memory on a single server. Other methods, like HNSW and NSG add an indexing structure on top of the raw vectors to make searching more efficient. The GPU implementation can accept input from either CPU or GPU memory. On a server with GPUs, the GPU indexes can be used a drop-in replacement for the CPU indexes (e.g., replace IndexFlatL2 with GpuIndexFlatL2) and copies to/from GPU memory are handled automatically. Results will be faster however if both input and output remain resident on the GPU. Both single and multi-GPU usage is supported."
791,81227005,2,C++,"Installing. Faiss comes with precompiled libraries for Anaconda in Python, see faiss-cpu @link  and faiss-gpu @link . The library is mostly implemented in C, the only dependency is a BLAS @link  implementation. Optional GPU support is provided via CUDA, and the Python interface is also optional. It compiles with cmake. See INSTALL.md(INSTALL.md) for details."
792,81227005,2,C++,"How Faiss works. Faiss is built around an index type that stores a set of vectors, and provides a function to search in them with L2 and/or dot product vector comparison. Some index types are simple baselines, such as exact search. Most of the available indexing structures correspond to various trade-offs with respect to - search time - search quality - memory used per index vector - training time - adding time - need for external data for unsupervised training The optional GPU implementation provides what is likely (as of March 2017) the fastest exact and approximate (compressed-domain) nearest neighbor search implementation for high-dimensional vectors, fastest Lloyd's k-means, and fastest small k-selection algorithm known.

798,81887991,2,C++,"AirSim announcement: This repository will be archived in the coming year . In 2017 Microsoft Research created AirSim as a simulation platform for AI research and experimentation. Over the span of five years, this research project has served its purpose—and gained a lot of ground—as a common way to share research code and test new ideas around aerial AI development and simulation. Additionally, time has yielded advancements in the way we apply technology to the real world, particularly through aerial mobility and autonomous systems. For example, drone delivery is no longer a sci-fi storyline—it’s a business reality, which means there are new needs to be met. We’ve learned a lot in the process, and we want to thank this community for your engagement along the way. In the spirit of forward momentum, we will be releasing a new simulation platform in the coming year and subsequently archiving the original 2017 AirSim. Users will still have access to the original AirSim code beyond that point, but no further updates will be made, effective immediately. Instead, we will focus our efforts on a new product, Microsoft Project AirSim, to meet the growing needs of the aerospace industry. Project AirSim will provide an end-to-end platform for safely developing and testing aerial autonomy through simulation. Users will benefit from the safety, code review, testing, advanced simulation, and AI capabilities that are uniquely available in a commercial product. As we get closer to the release of Project AirSim, there will be learning tools and features available to help you migrate to the new platform and to guide you through the product.

838,90902132,3,C++,"Global. Flameshot uses Print screen (Windows) and cmd-shift-x (macOS) as default global hotkeys. On Linux, Flameshot doesn't yet support Prt Sc out of the box, but with a bit of configuration you can set this up:"
839,90902132,4,C++,"On KDE Plasma desktop. To make configuration easier, there's a file(docs/shortcuts-config/flameshot-shortcuts-kde.khotkeys) in the repository that more or less automates this process. This file will assign the following hotkeys by default: If you don't like the defaults, they can be changed later. Steps for using the configuration: 1. The configuration file makes Flameshot automatically save screenshots to /Pictures/Screenshots without opening the save dialog. Make sure that folder exists by running: @Code (If you don't like the default location, you can skip this step and configure your preferred directory later.) 2. Download the configuration file: @Code 3. Make sure you have the khotkeys installed using your package manager to enable custom shortcuts in KDE Plasma. 4. Go to _System Settings_  _Shortcuts_  _Custom Shortcuts_. 5. If an entry exists for Spectacle (the default KDE screenshot utility), you'll need to disable it because its shortcuts might conflict with Flameshot's. Do this by unchecking the _Spectacle_ entry. 6. Click _Edit_  _Import..._, navigate to the configuration file and open it. 7. Now the Flameshot entry should appear in the list. Click _Apply_ to apply the changes. 8. If you want to change the default hotkeys, you can expand the entry, select the appropriate action and modify it as you wish; the process is pretty self-explanatory. 9. If you installed Flameshot as a Flatpak, you will need to create a symlink to the command: @Code"
840,90902132,4,C++,"On Ubuntu (Tested on 18.04, 20.04, 22.04). To use Flameshot instead of the default screenshot application in Ubuntu we need to remove the binding on Prt Sc key, and then create a new binding for /usr/bin/flameshot gui (adapted @link  from Pavel's answer on AskUbuntu @link ). 1. Remove the binding on Prt Sc: Ubuntu 18.04/20.04 using the following command: @Code Ubuntu 22.04: Go to _Settings_  _Keyboard_  _View and Customise Shortcuts_  _Screenshots_  _Take a screenshot interactively_ and press backspace 2.

Please review the prerequisites and installation steps in detail to ensure that you are well equipped to build and launch Apollo. You could also check out Apollo's architecture overview for a greater understanding of Apollo's core technology and platforms.
872,96246170,2,C++,"Prerequisites. New 2021-01 The Apollo platform (stable version) is now upgraded with software packages and library dependencies of newer versions including: 1. CUDA upgraded to version 11.1 to support Nvidia Ampere (30x0 series) GPUs, with NVIDIA driver  455.32 2. LibTorch (both CPU and GPU version) bumped to version 1.7.0 accordingly. We do not expect a disruption to your current work, but to ease your life of migration, you would need to: 1. Update NVIDIA driver on your host to version  455.32. (Web link @link ) 2. Pull latest code and run the following commands after restarting and logging into Apollo Development container: @Code --- - The vehicle equipped with the by-wire system, including but not limited to brake-by-wire, steering-by-wire, throttle-by-wire and shift-by-wire (Apollo is currently tested on Lincoln MKZ) - A machine with a 8-core processor and 16GB memory minimum - NVIDIA Turing GPU / AMD GFX9/RDNA/CDNA GPU is strongly recommended - Ubuntu 18.04 - NVIDIA driver version 455.32.00 and above (Web link @link ) or ROCm v5.1 @link  and above. - Docker-CE version 19.03 and above (Official doc @link ) - NVIDIA Container Toolkit (Official doc @link ) Please note, it is recommended that you install the versions of Apollo in the following order: 1.0 - whichever version you would like to test out. The reason behind this recommendation is that you need to confirm whether individual hardware components and modules are functioning correctly, and clear various version test cases before progressing to a higher and more capable version for your safety and the safety of those around you."

If you'd like to continue to use Newtonsoft.Json, add the Refit.Newtonsoft.Json NuGet package and set your ContentSerializer to NewtonsoftJsonContentSerializer on your RefitSettings instance. System.Text.Json is faster and uses less memory, though not all features are supported. The migration guide @link  contains more details. IContentSerializer was renamed to IHttpContentSerializer to better reflect its purpose. Additionally, two of its methods were renamed, SerializeAsync - ToHttpContent and DeserializeAsync - FromHttpContentAsync. Any existing implementations of these will need to be updated, though the changes should be minor."

914,11591313,3,C#,"API Attributes. Every method must have an HTTP attribute that provides the request method and relative URL. There are six built-in annotations: Get, Post, Put, Delete, Patch and Head. The relative URL of the resource is specified in the annotation. @Code You can also specify query parameters in the URL: @Code A request URL can be updated dynamically using replacement blocks and parameters on the method. A replacement block is an alphanumeric string surrounded by { and }. If the name of your parameter doesn't match the name in the URL path, use the AliasAs attribute. @Code A request url can also bind replacement blocks to a custom object @Code Parameters that are not specified as a URL substitution will automatically be used as query parameters. This is different than Retrofit, where all parameters must be explicitly specified. The comparison between parameter name and URL parameter is not case-sensitive, so it will work correctly if you name your parameter groupId in the path /group/{groupid}/show for example. @Code Round-tripping route parameter syntax: Forward slashes aren't encoded when using a double-asterisk (\\) catch-all parameter syntax. During link generation, the routing system encodes the value captured in a double-asterisk (\\) catch-all parameter (for example, {myparametername}) except the forward slashes. The type of round-tripping route parameter must be string. @Code"
915,11591313,4,C#,"Dynamic Querystring Parameters. If you specify an object as a query parameter, all public properties which are not null are used as query parameters. This previously only applied to GET requests, but has now been expanded to all HTTP request methods, partly thanks to Twitter's hybrid API that insists on non-GET requests with querystring parameters. Use the Query attribute to change the behavior to 'flatten' your query parameter object. If using this Attribute you can specify values for the Delimiter and the Prefix which are used to 'flatten' the object. @Code A similar behavior exists if using a Dictionary, but without the advantages of the AliasAs attributes and of course no intellisense and/or type safety. You can also specify querystring parameters with Query and have them flattened in non-GET requests, similar to: @Code Where TweetParams is a POCO, and properties will also support AliasAs attributes."
916,11591313,4,C#,"Collections as Querystring parameters. Use the Query attribute to specify format in which collections should be formatted in query string @Code You can also specify collection format in RefitSettings, that will be used by default, unless explicitly defined in Query attribute. @Code"
917,11591313,4,C#,Unescape Querystring parameters. Use the QueryUriFormat attribute to specify if the query parameters should be url escaped @Code
918,11591313,4,C#,"Custom Querystring parameter formatting. Formatting Keys To customize the format of query keys, you have two main options: 1. Using the AliasAs Attribute: You can use the AliasAs attribute to specify a custom key name for a property. This attribute will always take precedence over any key formatter you specify. @Code This will generate the following request: @Code 2. Using the RefitSettings.UrlParameterKeyFormatter Property: By default, Refit uses the property name as the query key without any additional formatting. If you want to apply a custom format across all your query keys, you can use the UrlParameterKeyFormatter property. Remember that if a property has an AliasAs attribute, it will be used regardless of the formatter. The following example uses the built-in CamelCaseUrlParameterKeyFormatter: @Code The request will look like: @Code Note: The AliasAs attribute always takes the top priority. If both the attribute and a custom key formatter are present, the AliasAs attribute's value will be used."
919,11591313,4,C#,"Formatting URL Parameter Values with the UrlParameterFormatter. In Refit, the UrlParameterFormatter property within RefitSettings allows you to customize how parameter values are formatted in the URL. This can be particularly useful when you need to format dates, numbers, or other types in a specific manner that aligns with your API's expectations. Using UrlParameterFormatter: Assign a custom formatter that implements the IUrlParameterFormatter interface to the UrlParameterFormatter property. @Code In this example, a custom formatter is created for date values. Whenever a DateTime parameter is encountered, it formats the date as yyyyMMdd. Formatting Dictionary Keys: When dealing with dictionaries, it's important to note that keys are treated as values. If you need custom formatting for dictionary keys, you should use the UrlParameterFormatter as well. For instance, if you have a dictionary parameter and you want to format its keys in a specific way, you can handle that in the custom formatter: @Code In the above example, the dictionary keys will be converted to uppercase."
920,11591313,3,C#,"Body content. One of the parameters in your method can be used as the body, by using the Body attribute: @Code There are four possibilities for supplying the body data, depending on the type of the parameter: If the type is Stream, the content will be streamed via StreamContent If the type is string, the string will be used directly as the content unless Body(BodySerializationMethod.Json) is set which will send it as a StringContent If the parameter has the attribute Body(BodySerializationMethod.UrlEncoded), the content will be URL-encoded (see form posts(form-posts) below). For all other types, the object will be serialized using the content serializer specified in RefitSettings (JSON is the default)."
921,11591313,4,C#,"Buffering and the Content-Length header. By default, Refit streams the body content without buffering it. This means you can stream a file from disk, for example, without incurring the overhead of loading the whole file into memory. The downside of this is that no Content-Length header is set _on the request_. If your API needs you to send a Content-Length header with the request, you can disable this streaming behavior by setting the buffered argument of the Body attribute to true: @Code"
922,11591313,4,C#,"JSON content. JSON requests and responses are serialized/deserialized using an instance of the IHttpContentSerializer interface. Refit provides two implementations out of the box: SystemTextJsonContentSerializer (which is the default JSON serializer) and NewtonsoftJsonContentSerializer. The first uses System.Text.Json APIs and is focused on high performance and low memory usage, while the latter uses the known Newtonsoft.Json library and is more versatile and customizable. You can read more about the two serializers and the main differences between the two at this link @link . For instance, here is how to create a new RefitSettings instance using the Newtonsoft.Json-based serializer (you'll also need to add a PackageReference to Refit.Newtonsoft.Json): @Code If you're using Newtonsoft.Json APIs, you can customize their behavior by setting the Newtonsoft.Json.JsonConvert.DefaultSettings property: @Code As these are global settings they will affect your entire application. It might be beneficial to isolate the settings for calls to a particular API. When creating a Refit generated live interface, you may optionally pass a RefitSettings that will allow you to specify what serializer settings you would like. This allows you to have different serializer settings for separate APIs: @Code Property serialization/deserialization can be customised using Json.NET's JsonProperty attribute: @Code"
923,11591313,5,C#,"JSON source generator. To apply the benefits of the new JSON source generator @link  for System.Text.Json added in .NET 6, you can use SystemTextJsonContentSerializer with a custom instance of RefitSettings and JsonSerializerOptions: @Code"
924,11591313,4,C#,"XML Content. XML requests and responses are serialized/deserialized using _System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer_. By default, Refit will use JSON content serialization, to use XML content configure the ContentSerializer to use the XmlContentSerializer: @Code Property serialization/deserialization can be customised using   attributes found in the _System.Xml.Serialization_ namespace: @Code The _System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer_ provides many options for serializing, those options can be set by providing an XmlContentSerializerSettings to the XmlContentSerializer constructor: @Code"
925,11591313,4,C#,"Form posts. For APIs that take form posts (i.e. serialized as application/x-www-form-urlencoded), initialize the Body attribute with BodySerializationMethod.UrlEncoded. The parameter can be an IDictionary: @Code Or you can just pass any object and all _public, readable_ properties will be serialized as form fields in the request. This approach allows you to alias property names using AliasAs('whatever') which can help if the API has cryptic field names: @Code If you have a type that has JsonProperty(PropertyName) attributes setting property aliases, Refit will use those too (AliasAs will take precedence where you have both). This means that the following type will serialize as onevalue1&twovalue2: @Code NOTE: This use of AliasAs applies to querystring parameters and form body posts, but not to response objects; for aliasing fields on response objects, you'll still need to use JsonProperty('full-property-name')."
926,11591313,4,C#,Static headers. You can set one or more static request headers for a request applying a Headers attribute to the method: @Code Static headers can also be added to _every request in the API_ by applying the Headers attribute to the interface: @Code
927,11591313,4,C#,"Dynamic headers. If the content of the header needs to be set at runtime, you can add a header with a dynamic value to a request by applying a Header attribute to a parameter: @Code Adding an Authorization header is such a common use case that you can add an access token to a request by applying an Authorize attribute to a parameter and optionally specifying the scheme: @Code If you need to set multiple headers at runtime, you can add a IDictionary and apply a HeaderCollection attribute to the parameter and it will inject the headers into the request: //:  ({% raw %}). @Code //:  ({% endraw %})."
928,11591313,4,C#,"Bearer Authentication. Most APIs need some sort of Authentication. The most common is OAuth Bearer authentication. A header is added to each request of the form: Authorization: Bearer . Refit makes it easy to insert your logic to get the token however your app needs, so you don't have to pass a token into each method. 1. Add Headers('Authorization: Bearer') to the interface or methods which need the token. 2. Set AuthorizationHeaderValueGetter in the RefitSettings instance. Refit will call your delegate each time it needs to obtain the token, so it's a good idea for your mechanism to cache the token value for some period within the token lifetime."
929,11591313,4,C#,"Reducing header boilerplate with DelegatingHandlers (Authorization headers worked example). Although we make provisions for adding dynamic headers at runtime directly in Refit, most use-cases would likely benefit from registering a custom DelegatingHandler in order to inject the headers as part of the HttpClient middleware pipeline thus removing the need to add lots of Header or HeaderCollection attributes. In the example above we are leveraging a HeaderCollection parameter to inject an Authorization and X-Tenant-Id header. This is quite a common scenario if you are integrating with a 3rd party that uses OAuth2. While it's ok for the occasional endpoint, it would be quite cumbersome if we had to add that boilerplate to every method in our interface. In this example we will assume our application is a multi-tenant application that is able to pull information about a tenant through some interface ITenantProvider and has a data store IAuthTokenStore that can be used to retrieve an auth token to attach to the outbound request. @Code If you aren't using dependency injection then you could achieve the same thing by doing something like this: @Code"
930,11591313,4,C#,"Redefining headers. Unlike Retrofit, where headers do not overwrite each other and are all added to the request regardless of how many times the same header is defined, Refit takes a similar approach to the approach ASP.NET MVC takes with action filters &mdash; redefining a header will replace it, in the following order of precedence: Headers attribute on the interface _(lowest priority)_ Headers attribute on the method Header attribute or HeaderCollection attribute on a method parameter _(highest priority)_ @Code Note: This redefining behavior only applies to headers _with the same name_. Headers with different names are not replaced. The following code will result in all headers being included: @Code"
931,11591313,4,C#,Removing headers. Headers defined on an interface or method can be removed by redefining a static header without a value (i.e. without : ) or passing null for a dynamic header. _Empty strings will be included as empty headers._ @Code
932,11591313,3,C#,Passing state into DelegatingHandlers. If there is runtime state that you need to pass to a DelegatingHandler you can add a property with a dynamic value to the underlying HttpRequestMessage.Properties by applying a Property attribute to a parameter: @Code The attribute constructor optionally takes a string which becomes the key in the HttpRequestMessage.Properties dictionary. If no key is explicitly defined then the name of the parameter becomes the key. If a key is defined multiple times the value in HttpRequestMessage.Properties will be overwritten. The parameter itself can be any object. Properties can be accessed inside a DelegatingHandler as follows: @Code Note: in .NET 5 HttpRequestMessage.Properties has been marked Obsolete and Refit will instead populate the value into the new HttpRequestMessage.Options.
933,11591313,4,C#,Support for Polly and Polly.Context. Because Refit supports HttpClientFactory it is possible to configure Polly policies on your HttpClient. If your policy makes use of Polly.Context this can be passed via Refit by adding Property('PolicyExecutionContext') Polly.Context context as behind the scenes Polly.Context is simply stored in HttpRequestMessage.Properties under the key PolicyExecutionContext and is of type Polly.Context. It's only recommended to pass the Polly.Context this way if your use case requires that the Polly.Context be initialized with dynamic content only known at runtime. If your Polly.Context only requires the same content every time (e.g an ILogger that you want to use to log from inside your policies) a cleaner approach is to inject the Polly.Context via a DelegatingHandler as described in 801 @link .
934,11591313,4,C#,"Target Interface Type and method info. There may be times when you want to know what the target interface type is of the Refit instance. An example is where you have a derived interface that implements a common base like this: @Code You can access the concrete type of the interface for use in a handler, such as to alter the URL of the request: //:  ({% raw %}). @Code //:  ({% endraw %}). The full method information (RestMethodInfo) is also always available in the request options. The RestMethodInfo contains more information about the method being called such as the full MethodInfo when using reflection is needed: //:  ({% raw %}). @Code //:  ({% endraw %}). Note: in .NET 5 HttpRequestMessage.Properties has been marked Obsolete and Refit will instead populate the value into the new HttpRequestMessage.Options. Refit provides HttpRequestMessageOptions.InterfaceTypeKey and HttpRequestMessageOptions.RestMethodInfoKey to respectively access the interface type and REST method info from the options."
935,11591313,3,C#,"Multipart uploads. Methods decorated with Multipart attribute will be submitted with multipart content type. At this time, multipart methods support the following parameter types: - string (parameter name will be used as name and string value as value) - byte array - Stream - FileInfo Name of the field in the multipart data priority precedence: multipartItem.Name if specified and not null (optional); dynamic, allows naming form data part at execution time. AliasAs attribute  (optional) that decorate the streamPart parameter in the method signature (see below); static, defined in code. MultipartItem parameter name (default) as defined in the method signature; static, defined in code. A custom boundary can be specified with an optional string parameter to the Multipart attribute. If left empty, this defaults to ----MyGreatBoundary. To specify the file name and content type for byte array (byte), Stream and FileInfo parameters, use of a wrapper class is required. The wrapper classes for these types are ByteArrayPart, StreamPart and FileInfoPart. @Code To pass a Stream to this method, construct a StreamPart object like so: @Code Note: The AttachmentName attribute that was previously described in this section has been deprecated and its use is not recommended."
936,11591313,3,C#,"Retrieving the response. Note that in Refit unlike in Retrofit, there is no option for a synchronous network request - all requests must be async, either via Task or via IObservable. There is also no option to create an async method via a Callback parameter unlike Retrofit, because we live in the async/await future. Similarly to how body content changes via the parameter type, the return type will determine the content returned. Returning Task without a type parameter will discard the content and solely tell you whether or not the call succeeded: @Code If the type parameter is 'HttpResponseMessage' or 'string', the raw response message or the content as a string will be returned respectively. @Code There is also a generic wrapper class called ApiResponse that can be used as a return type. Using this class as a return type allows you to retrieve not just the content as an object, but also any metadata associated with the request/response. This includes information such as response headers, the http status code and reason phrase (e.g. 404 Not Found), the response version, the original request message that was sent and in the case of an error, an ApiException object containing details of the error. Following are some examples of how you can retrieve the response metadata. @Code"
937,11591313,3,C#,"Using generic interfaces. When using something like ASP.NET Web API, it's a fairly common pattern to have a whole stack of CRUD REST services. Refit now supports these, allowing you to define a single API interface with a generic type: @Code Which can be used like this: @Code"
938,11591313,3,C#,"Interface inheritance. When multiple services that need to be kept separate share a number of APIs, it is possible to leverage interface inheritance to avoid having to define the same Refit methods multiple times in different services: @Code In this example, the IDerivedServiceA interface will expose both the GetResource and DeleteResource APIs, while IDerivedServiceB will expose GetResource and AddResource."
939,11591313,4,C#,"Headers inheritance. When using inheritance, existing header attributes will be passed along as well, and the inner-most ones will have precedence: @Code Here, IAmInterfaceB.Pang() will use PANG as its user agent, while IAmInterfaceB.Foo and IAmInterfaceB.Ping will use BBB. Note that if IAmInterfaceB didn't have a header attribute, Foo would then use the AAA value inherited from IAmInterfaceA. If an interface is inheriting more than one interface, the order of precedence is the same as the one in which the inherited interfaces are declared: @Code Here IAmInterfaceC.Foo would use the header attribute inherited from IAmInterfaceA, if present, or the one inherited from IAmInterfaceB, and so on for all the declared interfaces."
940,11591313,3,C#,"Default Interface Methods. Starting with C 8.0, default interface methods (a.k.a. DIMs) can be defined on interfaces. Refit interfaces can provide additional logic using DIMs, optionally combined with private and/or static helper methods:. @Code The type generated by Refit will implement the method IApiClient.GetInternal. If additional logic is required immediately before or after its invocation, it shouldn't be exposed directly and can thus be hidden from consumers by being marked as internal. The default interface method IApiClient.Get will be inherited by all types implementing IApiClient, including - of course - the type generated by Refit. Consumers of the IApiClient will call the public Get method and profit from the additional logic provided in its implementation (optionally, in this case, with the help of the private static helper FormatResponse). To support runtimes without DIM-support (.NET Core 2.x and below or .NET Standard 2.0 and below), two additional types would be required for the same solution. @Code"

Add a reference to Refit.HttpClientFactory and call the provided extension method in your ConfigureServices method to configure your Refit interface: @Code Optionally, a RefitSettings object can be included: @Code Note that some of the properties of RefitSettings will be ignored because the HttpClient and HttpClientHandlers will be managed by the HttpClientFactory instead of Refit. You can then get the api interface using constructor injection: @Code"

971,120231691,3,C#,"Step 3. To build Ryujinx, open a command prompt inside the project directory. You can quickly access it on Windows by holding shift in File Explorer, then right clicking and selecting Open command window here.

This folder is located in the user folder, which can be accessed by clicking Open Ryujinx Folder under the File menu in the GUI."
972,120231691,2,C#,"Features. - Audio Audio output is entirely supported, audio input (microphone) isn't supported. We use C wrappers for OpenAL @link , and SDL2 @link  & libsoundio @link  as fallbacks.. - CPU The CPU emulator, ARMeilleure, emulates an ARMv8 CPU and currently has support for most 64-bit ARMv8 and some of the ARMv7 (and older) instructions, including partial 32-bit support. It translates the ARM code to a custom IR, performs a few optimizations, and turns that into x86 code. There are three memory manager options available depending on the user's preference, leveraging both software-based (slower) and host-mapped modes (much faster). The fastest option (host, unchecked) is set by default. Ryujinx also features an optional Profiled Persistent Translation Cache, which essentially caches translated functions so that they do not need to be translated every time the game loads. The net result is a significant reduction in load times (the amount of time between launching a game and arriving at the title screen) for nearly every game. NOTE: This feature is enabled by default in the Options menu  System tab. You must launch the game at least twice to the title screen or beyond before performance improvements are unlocked on the third launch! These improvements are permanent and do not require any extra launches going forward. - GPU The GPU emulator emulates the Switch's Maxwell GPU using either the OpenGL (version 4.5 minimum), Vulkan, or Metal (via MoltenVK) APIs through a custom build of OpenTK or Silk.NET respectively. There are currently six graphics enhancements available to the end user in Ryujinx: Disk Shader Caching, Resolution Scaling, Anti-Aliasing, Scaling Filters (including FSR), Anisotropic Filtering and Aspect Ratio Adjustment. These enhancements can be adjusted or toggled as desired in the GUI. - Input We currently have support for keyboard, mouse, touch input, JoyCon input support, and nearly all controllers. Motion controls are natively supported in most cases; for dual-JoyCon motion support, DS4Windows or BetterJoy are currently required. In all scenarios, you can set up everything inside the input configuration menu. - DLC & Modifications Ryujinx is able to manage add-on content/downloadable content through the GUI. Mods (romfs, exefs, and runtime mods such as cheats) are also supported; the GUI contains a shortcut to open the respective mods folder for a particular game. - Configuration The emulator has settings for enabling or disabling some logging, remapping controllers, and more. You can configure all of them through the graphical interface or manually through the config file, Config.json, found in the user folder which can be accessed by clicking Open Ryujinx Folder under the File menu in the GUI."

977,12191244,2,C#,"Features. BenchmarkDotNet has tons of features that are essential in comprehensive performance investigations. Four aspects define the design of these features: simplicity, automation, reliability, and friendliness."
978,12191244,3,C#,"Simplicity. You shouldn't be an experienced performance engineer if you want to write benchmarks. You can design very complicated performance experiments in the declarative style using simple APIs. For example, if you want to parameterize @link  your benchmark, mark a field or a property with Params(1, 2, 3): BenchmarkDotNet will enumerate all of the specified values and run benchmarks for each case. If you want to compare benchmarks with each other, mark one of the benchmarks as the baseline @link via Benchmark(Baseline  true): BenchmarkDotNet will compare it with all of the other benchmarks. If you want to compare performance in different environments, use jobs @link . For example, you can run all the benchmarks on .NET Core 3.0 and Mono via SimpleJob(RuntimeMoniker.NetCoreApp30) and SimpleJob(RuntimeMoniker.Mono). If you don't like attributes, you can call most of the APIs via the fluent style and write code like this: @Code If you prefer command-line experience, you can configure your benchmarks via the console arguments @link in any console application (other types of applications are not supported)."
979,12191244,3,C#,"Automation. Reliable benchmarks always include a lot of boilerplate code. Let's think about what you should do in a typical case. First, you should perform a pilot experiment and determine the best number of method invocations. Next, you should execute several warm-up iterations and ensure that your benchmark achieved a steady state. After that, you should execute the main iterations and calculate some basic statistics. If you calculate some values in your benchmark, you should use it somehow to prevent dead code elimination. If you use loops, you should care about the effect of the loop unrolling on your results (which may depend on the processor architecture). Once you get results, you should check for some special properties of the obtained performance distribution like multimodality or extremely high outliers. You should also evaluate the overhead of your infrastructure and deduct it from your results. If you want to test several environments, you should perform the measurements in each of them and manually aggregate the results. If you write this code from scratch, it's easy to make a mistake and spoil your measurements. Note that it's a shortened version of the full checklist that you should follow during benchmarking: there are a lot of additional hidden pitfalls that should be handled appropriately. Fortunately, you shouldn't worry about it because BenchmarkDotNet will perform @link  this boring and time-consuming stuff for you. Moreover, the library can help you with some advanced tasks that you may want to perform during the investigation. For example, BenchmarkDotNet can measure the managed @link  and. native @link  memory traffic and print disassembly listings @link  for your benchmarks.."
980,12191244,3,C#,"Reliability. A lot of hand-written benchmarks produce wrong numbers that lead to incorrect business decisions. BenchmarkDotNet protects you from most of the benchmarking pitfalls and allows achieving high measurement precision. You shouldn't worry about the perfect number of method invocation, the number of warm-up and actual iterations: BenchmarkDotNet tries to choose the best benchmarking parameters and achieve a good trade-off between the measurement prevision and the total duration of all benchmark runs. So, you shouldn't use any magic numbers (like 'We should perform 100 iterations here'), the library will do it for you based on the values of statistical metrics. BenchmarkDotNet also prevents benchmarking of non-optimized assemblies that were built using DEBUG mode because the corresponding results will be unreliable. The library will print a warning if you have an attached debugger, if you use a hypervisor (HyperV, VMware, VirtualBox), or if you have any other problems with the current environment. During 6 years of development, we faced dozens of different problems that may spoil your measurements. Inside BenchmarkDotNet, there are a lot of heuristics, checks, hacks, and tricks that help you to increase the reliability of the results."
981,12191244,3,C#,"Friendliness. Analysis of performance data is a time-consuming activity that requires attentiveness, knowledge, and experience. BenchmarkDotNet performs the main part of this analysis for you and presents results in a user-friendly form. After the experiments, you get a summary table that contains a lot of useful data about the executed benchmarks. By default, it includes only the most important columns, but they can be easily customized @link . The column set is adaptive and depends on the benchmark definition and measured values. For example, if you mark one of the benchmarks as a baseline @link , you will get additional columns that will help you to compare all the benchmarks with the baseline. By default, it always shows the Mean column, but if we detected a vast difference between the Mean and the Median values, both columns will be presented. BenchmarkDotNet tries to find some unusual properties of your performance distributions and prints nice messages about it. For example, it will warn you in case of multimodal distribution or high outliers. In this case, you can scroll the results up and check out ASCII-style histograms for each distribution or generate beautiful png plots using RPlotExporter. BenchmarkDotNet doesn't overload you with data; it shows only the essential information depending on your results: it allows you to keep the summary small for primitive cases and extend it only for complicated cases. Of course, you can request any additional statistics and visualizations manually. If you don't customize the summary view, the default presentation will be as much user-friendly as possible. :)"
982,12191244,2,C#,"Learn more about benchmarking. BenchmarkDotNet is not a silver bullet that magically makes all of your benchmarks correct and analyzes the measurements for you. Even if you use this library, you still should know how to design benchmark experiments and how to make correct conclusions based on the raw data. If you want to know more about benchmarking methodology and good practices, it's recommended to read a book by Andrey Akinshin (the BenchmarkDotNet project lead): 'Pro .NET Benchmarking' @link . Use this in-depth guide to correctly design benchmarks, measure key performance metrics of .NET applications, and analyze results. This book presents dozens of case studies to help you understand complicated benchmarking topics. You will avoid common pitfalls, control the accuracy of your measurements, and improve the performance of your software."

Instructions to run this project from the command line are included here, but you will also need to install an IDE if you want to debug the server while it is running. Any IDE that supports .NET 6 development will work, but two options are recent versions of Visual Studio @link  (at least 2022) and Visual Studio Code @link . ffmpeg @link  will also need to be installed."
1046,161012019,3,C#,"Cloning the Repository. After dependencies are installed you will need to clone a local copy of this repository. If you just want to run the server from source you can clone this repository directly, but if you are intending to contribute code changes to the project, you should set up your own fork @link  of the repository. The following example shows how you can clone the repository directly over HTTPS.. @Code"

Note that it is also possible to host the web client separately(hosting-the-web-client-separately) from the web server with some additional configuration, in which case you can skip this step.. There are three options to get the files for the web client. 1. Download one of the finished builds from the Azure DevOps pipeline @link . You can download the build for a specific release by looking at the branches tab @link  of the pipelines page. 2.

After the required extensions are installed, you can run the server by pressing F5."
1051,161012019,4,C#,"Running From The Command Line. To run the server from the command line you can use the dotnet run command. The example below shows how to do this if you have cloned the repository into a directory named jellyfin (the default directory name) and should work on all operating systems. @Code A second option is to build the project and then run the resulting executable file directly. When running the executable directly you can easily add command line options. Add the --help flag to list details on all the supported command line options. 1. Build the project @Code 2.

NOTE: Depending on the selected configuration (if you just click 'create codespace' it will create a default configuration one) it might take 20-30 seconds to load all extensions and prepare the environment while VS Code is already open. Just give it some time and wait until you see Downloading .NET version(s) 7.0.15x64 ...... Done! in the output tab. NOTE: If you want to access the JF instance from outside, like with a WebClient on another PC, remember to set the 'ports' in the lower VS Code window to public. NOTE: When first opening the server instance with any WebUI, you will be sent to the login instead of the setup page. Refresh the login page once and you should be redirected to the Setup.

Use the .NET Launch (nowebclient) launch config to start the server. Keep in mind that as this has no web client you have to connect to it via an external client.

1058,161012019,4,C#,"Hosting The Web Client Separately. It is not necessary to host the frontend web client as part of the backend server. Hosting these two components separately may be useful for frontend developers who would prefer to host the client in a separate webpack development server for a tighter development loop. See the jellyfin-web @link  repo for instructions on how to do this.. To instruct the server not to host the web content, there is a nowebclient configuration flag that must be set. This can specified using the command line switch --nowebclient or the environment variable JELLYFIN_NOWEBCONTENTtrue. Since this is a common scenario, there is also a separate launch profile defined for Visual Studio called Jellyfin.Server (nowebcontent) that can be selected from the 'Start Debugging' dropdown in the main toolbar. NOTE: The setup wizard can not be run if the web client is hosted separately. --- This project is supported by: &nbsp;"

1137,189676777,2,C#,"What is Notepads and why do I care?. I have been waiting long enough for a modern Windows 10 notepad app to come before I decided to create one myself. Don’t get me wrong, Notepad, VS Code, and Sublime are great text editors. I have used them all and I will continue to use them in the future. However, they are either too heavy or look less appealing. There are times that I just wanted to use Windows notepad for things like writing notes or editing config files. So I decided to create a win32 notepad replacement here and try to give it a modern look and feel. Most importantly, it has to be blazingly fast and appeals to everyone. So here comes the “Notepads”  (s stands for Sets). Fluent design with a built-in tab system. Blazingly fast and lightweight. Launch from the command line or PowerShell by typing: notepads or notepads %FilePath%. Multi-line handwriting support. Built-in Markdown live preview. Built-in diff viewer (preview your changes). Session snapshot and multi-instances."
1138,189676777,2,C#,Shortcuts:. CtrlN/T to create new tab. Ctrl(Shift)Tab to switch between tabs. CtrlNum(1-9) to quickly switch to specified tab. Ctrl''/'-' for zooming. Ctrl'0' to reset zooming to default. CtrlL/R to change text flow direction. (LTR/RTL) AltP to toggle preview split view for Markdown file. AltD to toggle side-by-side diff viewer.
1139,189676777,2,C#,"Platform limitations (UWP):. You won't be able to save files to system folders due to UWP restriction (windows, system32, etc.).

I will add large file support later."
1140,189676777,2,C#,Downloads:. Notepads is available in the Microsoft Store. You can get the latest version of Notepads here for free: Microsoft Store Link @link . You can also use the Windows Package Manager to install notepads: @Code

This is a list of the main goals of this repository: - Showing how you can implement a monolith application in a modular way - Presentation of the full implementation of an application - This is not another simple application - This is not another proof of concept (PoC) - The goal is to present the implementation of an application that would be ready to run in production - Showing the application of best practices and object-oriented programming principles - Presentation of the use of design patterns. When, how and why they can be used - Presentation of some architectural considerations, decisions, approaches - Presentation of the implementation using Domain-Driven Design approach (tactical patterns) - Presentation of the implementation of Unit Tests for Domain Model (Testable Design in mind) - Presentation of the implementation of Integration Tests - Presentation of the implementation of Event Sourcing - Presentation of C4 Model - Presentation of diagram as text approach"

1184,203892454,3,C#,"1.3 Reason. The reason for creating this repository is the lack of something similar. Most sample applications on GitHub have at least one of the following issues: - Very, very simple - few entities and use cases implemented - Not finished (for example there is no authentication, logging, etc..) - Poorly designed (in my opinion) - Poorly implemented (in my opinion) - Not well described - Assumptions and decisions are not clearly explained - Implements 'Orders' domain - yes, everyone knows this domain, but something different is needed - Implemented in old technology - Not maintained To sum up, there are some very good examples, but there are far too few of them. This repository has the task of filling this gap at some level."
1185,203892454,3,C#,"1.4 Disclaimer. Software architecture should always be created to resolve specific business problems. Software architecture always supports some quality attributes and at the same time does not support others. A lot of other factors influence your software architecture - your team, opinions, preferences, experiences, technical constraints, time, budget, etc. Always functional requirements, quality attributes, technical constraints and other factors should be considered before an architectural decision is made. Because of the above, the architecture and implementation presented in this repository is one of the many ways to solve some problems. Take from this repository as much as you want, use it as you like but remember to always pick the best solution which is appropriate to the problem class you have."

Domain-Driven Design Reference @link , Eric Evans The Meeting Groups domain was selected for the purposes of this project based on the Meetup.com @link  system. Main reasons for selecting this domain: - It is common, a lot of people use the Meetup site to organize or attend meetings - There is a system for it, so everyone can check this implementation against a working site which supports this domain - It is not complex so it is easy to understand - It is not trivial - there are some business rules and logic and it is not just CRUD operations - You don't need much specific domain knowledge unlike other domains like financing, banking, medical - It is not big so it is easier to implement Meetings The main business entities are Member, Meeting Group and Meeting. A Member can create a Meeting Group, be part of a Meeting Group or can attend a Meeting. A Meeting Group Member can be an Organizer of this group or a normal Member. Only an Organizer of a Meeting Group can create a new Meeting. A Meeting has attendees, not attendees (Members which declare they will not attend the Meeting) and Members on the Waitlist. A Meeting can have an attendee limit. If the limit is reached, Members can only sign up to the Waitlist. A Meeting Attendee can bring guests to the Meeting. The number of guests allowed is an attribute of the Meeting. Bringing guests can be unallowed. A Meeting Attendee can have one of two roles: Attendee or Host. A Meeting must have at least one Host. The Host is a special role which grants permission to edit Meeting information or change the attendees list. A Member can comment Meetings. A Member can reply to, like other Comments. Organizer manages commenting of Meeting by Meeting Commenting Configuration. Organizer can delete any Comment. Each Meeting Group must have an organizer with active Subscription. One organizer can cover 3 Meeting Groups by his Subscription. Additionally, Meeting organizer can set an Event Fee. Each Meeting Attendee is obliged to pay the fee. All guests should be paid by Meeting Attendee too. Administration To create a new Meeting Group, a Member needs to propose the group. A Meeting Group Proposal is sent to Administrators. An Administrator can accept or reject a Meeting Group Proposal. If a Meeting Group Proposal is accepted, a Meeting Group is created. Payments Each Member who is the Payer can buy the Subscription. He needs to pay the Subscription Payment. Subscription can expire so Subscription Renewal is required (by Subscription Renewal Payment payment to keep Subscription active). When the Meeting fee is required, the Payer needs to pay Meeting Fee (through Meeting Fee Payment). Users Each Administrator, Member and Payer is a User. To be a User, User Registration is required and confirmed. Each User is assigned one or more User Role. Each User Role has set of Permissions. A Permission defines whether User can invoke a particular action."

Key assumptions: 1. API contains no application logic 2. API communicates with Modules using a small interface to send Queries and Commands 3. Each Module has its own interface which is used by API 4. Modules communicate each other only asynchronously using Events Bus - direct method calls are not allowed 5. Each Module has it's own data in a separate schema - shared data is not allowed - Module data could be moved into separate databases if desired 6. Modules can only have a dependency on the integration events assembly of other Module (see Module level view(32-module-level-view)). 7. Each Module has its own Composition Root @link , which implies that each Module has its own Inversion-of-Control container 8.

1198,203892454,3,C#,"3.3 API and Module Communication. The API only communicates with Modules in two ways: during module initialization and request processing. Module initialization Each module has a static Initialize method which is invoked in the API Startup class. All configuration needed by this module should be provided as arguments to this method. All services are configured during initialization and the Composition Root is created using the Inversion-of-Control Container. @Code Request processing Each module has the same interface signature exposed to the API. It contains 3 methods: command with result, command without result and query. @Code Note: Some people say that processing a command should not return a result. This is an understandable approach but sometimes impractical, especially when you want to immediately return the ID of a newly created resource. Sometimes the boundary between Command and Query is blurry. One example is AuthenticateCommand - it returns a token but it is not a query because it has a side effect."

1201,203892454,3,C#,"3.6 Cross-Cutting Concerns. To support Single Responsibility Principle @link  and Don't Repeat Yourself @link  principles, the implementation of cross-cutting concerns is done using the Decorator Pattern @link .

This way each log inside a processor has the log context of the processing command. @Code Validation The Validation decorator performs Command data validation. It checks rules against Command arguments using the FluentValidation library. @Code Unit Of Work All Command processing has side effects. To avoid calling commit on every handler, UnitOfWorkCommandHandlerDecorator is used. It additionally marks InternalCommand as processed (if it is Internal Command) and dispatches all Domain Events (as part of Unit Of Work @link ). @Code"
1202,203892454,3,C#,"3.7 Modules Integration. Integration between modules is strictly asynchronous using Integration Events and the In Memory Event Bus as broker. In this way coupling between modules is minimal and exists only on the structure of Integration Events. Modules don't share data so it is not possible nor desirable to create a transaction which spans more than one module. To ensure maximum reliability, the Outbox / Inbox pattern @link  is used. This pattern provides accordingly 'At-Least-Once delivery' and 'At-Least-Once processing'. !(docs/Images/OutboxInbox.jpg) The Outbox and Inbox is implemented using two SQL tables and a background worker for each module. The background worker is implemented using the Quartz.NET library. Saving to Outbox: !(docs/Images/OutboxSave.png) Processing Outbox: !(docs/Images/OutboxProcessing.png)"
1203,203892454,3,C#,"3.8 Internal Processing. The main principle of this system is that you can change its state only by calling a specific Command. Commands can be called not only by the API, but by the processing module itself. The main use case which implements this mechanism is data processing in eventual consistency mode when we want to process something in a different process and transaction. This applies, for example, to Inbox processing because we want to do something (calling a Command) based on an Integration Event from the Inbox. This idea is taken from Alberto's Brandolini's Event Storming picture called 'The picture that explains “almost” everything' which shows that every side effect (domain event) is created by invoking a Command on Aggregate. See EventStorming cheat sheet @link  article for more details. Implementation of internal processing is very similar to implementation of the Outbox and Inbox. One SQL table and one background worker for processing. Each internally processing Command must inherit from InternalCommandBase class: @Code This is important because the UnitOfWorkCommandHandlerDecorator must mark an internal Command as processed during committing: @Code"

1205,203892454,3,C#,"3.10 Unit Tests. Definition: A unit test is an automated piece of code that invokes the unit of work being tested, and then checks some assumptions about a single end result of that unit. A unit test is almost always written using a unit testing framework. It can be written easily and runs quickly. It’s trustworthy, readable, and maintainable. It’s consistent in its results as long as production code hasn’t changed. Art of Unit Testing 2nd Edition @link  Roy Osherove Attributes of good unit test - Automated - Maintainable - Runs very fast (in ms) - Consistent, Deterministic (always the same result) - Isolated from other tests - Readable - Can be executed by anyone - Testing public API, not internal behavior (overspecification) - Looks like production code - Treated as production code Implementation Unit tests should mainly test business logic (domain model): !(docs/Images/unit_tests.jpg) Each unit test has 3 standard sections: Arrange, Act and Assert: !(docs/Images/UnitTestsGeneral.jpg) 1\. Arrange The Arrange section is responsible for preparing the Aggregate for testing the public method that we want to test. This public method is often called (from the unit tests perspective) the SUT (system under test). Creating an Aggregate ready for testing involves calling one or more other public constructors/methods on the Domain Model. At first it may seem that we are testing too many things at the same time, but this is not true. We need to be one hundred percent sure that the Aggregate is in a state exactly as it will be in production. This can only be ensured when we: - Use only public API of Domain Model - Don't use InternalsVisibleToAttribute @link  class - This exposes the Domain Model to the Unit Tests library, removing encapsulation so our tests and production code are treated differently and it is a very bad thing - Don't use ConditionalAttribute @link  classes - it reduces readability and increases complexity - Don't create any special constructors/factory methods for tests (even with conditional compilation symbols) - Special constructor/factory method only for unit tests causes duplication of business logic in the test itself and focuses on state - this kind of approach causes the test to be very sensitive to changes and hard to maintain - Don't remove encapsulation from Domain Model (for example: change keywords from internal/private to public) - Don't make methods protected to inherit from tested class and in this way provide access to internal methods/properties Isolation of external dependencies There are 2 main concepts - stubs and mocks: A stub is a controllable replacement for an existing dependency (or collaborator) in the system. By using a stub, you can test your code without dealing with the dependency directly. A mock object is a fake object in the system that decides whether the unit test has passed or failed. It does so by verifying whether the object under test called the fake object as expected. There’s usually no more than one mock per test. Art of Unit Testing 2nd Edition @link  Roy Osherove Good advice: use stubs if you need to, but try to avoid mocks. Mocking causes us to test too many internal things and leads to overspecification. 2\. Act This section is very easy - we execute exactly one public method on aggregate (SUT). 3\. Assert In this section we check expectations. There are only 2 possible outcomes: - Method completed and Domain Event(s) published - Business rule was broken Simple example: @Code Advanced example: @Code CreateMeetingTestData method is an implementation of SUT Factory @link  described by Mark Seemann which allows keeping common creation logic in one place: @Code"

1207,203892454,3,C#,"3.12 Architecture Unit Tests. In some cases it is not possible to enforce the application architecture, design or established conventions using compiler (compile-time). For this reason, code implementations can diverge from the original design and architecture. We want to minimize this behavior, not only by code review. To do this, unit tests of system architecture, design, major conventions and assumptions  have been written. In .NET there is special library for this task: NetArchTest @link . This library has been written based on the very popular JAVA architecture unit tests library - ArchUnit @link . Using this kind of tests we can test proper layering of our application, dependencies, encapsulation, immutability, DDD correct implementation, naming, conventions and so on - everything what we need to test.

1208,203892454,4,C#,"Definition. 'Integration Test' term is blurred. It can mean test between classes, modules, services, even systems - see this @link  article (by Martin Fowler). For this reason, the definition of integration test in this project is as follows: - it verifies how system works in integration with 'out-of-process' dependencies - database, messaging system, file system or external API - it tests particular use case - it can be slow (as opposed to Unit Test)"
1209,203892454,4,C#,"Approach. - Do not mock dependencies over which you have full control (like database). Full control dependency means you can always revert all changes (remove side-effects) and no one can notice it. They are not visible to others. See next point, please. - Use 'production', normal, real database version. Some use e.g. in memory repository, some use light databases instead 'production' version. This is still mocking. Testing makes sense if we have full confidence in testing. You can't trust the test if you know that the infrastructure in the production environment will vary. Be always as close to production environment as possible. - Mock dependencies over which you don't have control. No control dependency means you can't remove side-effects after interaction with this dependency (external API, messaging system, SMTP server etc.). They can be visible to others."
1210,203892454,4,C#,"Implementation. Integration test should test exactly one use case. One use case is represented by one Command/Query processing so CommandHandler/QueryHandler in Application layer is perfect starting point for running the Integration Test: !(docs/Images/integration_tests.jpg) For each test, the following preparation steps must be performed: 1. Clear database 2. Prepare mocks 3. Initialize testing module @Code After preparation, test is performed on clear database. Usually, it is the execution of some (or many) Commands and: a) running a Query or/and b) verifying mocks to check the result. @Code Each Command/Query processing is a separate execution (with different object graph resolution, context, database connection etc.) thanks to Composition Root of each module. This behavior is important and desirable."

1212,203892454,4,C#,Definition. System Integration Testing (SIT) @link  is performed to verify the interactions between the modules of a software system. It involves the overall testing of a complete system of many subsystem components or elements.
1213,203892454,4,C#,"Implementation. Implementation of system integration tests is based on approach of integration testing of modules in isolation (invoking commands and queries) described in the previous section. The problem is that in this case we are dealing with asynchronous communication. Due to asynchrony, our test must wait for the result at certain times. To correctly implement such tests, the Sampling technique and implementation described in the Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests @link  book was used: An asynchronous test must wait for success and use timeouts to detect failure. This implies that every tested activity must have an observable effect: a test must affect the system so that its observable state becomes different. This sounds obvious but it drives how we think about writing asynchronous tests. If an activity has no observable effect, there is nothing the test can wait for, and therefore no way for the test to synchronize with the system it is testing. There are two ways a test can observe the system: by sampling its observable state or by listening for events that it sends out. !(docs/Images/SystemIntegrationTests.jpg) Test below: 1. Creates Meeting Group Proposal in Meetings module 2. Waits until Meeting Group Proposal to verification will be available in Administration module with 10 seconds timeout 3.

1214,203892454,4,C#,"Theory. During the implementation of the Payment module, Event Sourcing was used. Event Sourcing is a way of preserving the state of our system by recording a sequence of events. No less, no more. It is important here to really restore the state of our application from events. If we collect events only for auditing purposes, it is an Audit Log/Trail @link  - not the Event Sourcing. The main elements of Event Sourcing are as follows: - Events Stream - Objects that are restored based on events. There are 2 types of such objects depending on the purpose: -- Objects responsible for the change of state. In Domain-Driven Design they will be Aggregates. -- Projections: read models prepared for a specific purpose - Subscriptions : a way to receive information about new events - Snapshots: from time to time, objects saved in the traditional way for performance purposes. Mainly used if there are many events to restore the object from the entire event history. (Note: there is currently no snapshot implementation in the project) !(docs/Images/ES_elements.jpg)"
1215,203892454,4,C#,"Tool. In order not to reinvent the wheel, the SQL Stream Store library was used. As the documentation @link  says: SQL Stream Store is a .NET library to assist with developing applications that use event sourcing or wish to use stream based patterns over a relational database and existing operational infrastructure. Like every library, it has its limitations and assumptions (I recommend the linked documentation chapter 'Things you need to know before adopting'). For me, the most important 2 points from this chapter are: 1. 'Subscriptions (and thus projections) are eventually consistent and always will be.' This means that there will always be an inconsistency time from saving the event to the stream and processing the event by the projector(s). 2. 'No support for ambient System.Transaction scopes enforcing the concept of the stream as the consistency and transactional boundary.' This means that if we save the event to a events stream and want to save something in the same transaction, we must use TransactionScope @link . If we cannot use TransactionScope for some reason, we must accept the Eventual Consistency also in this case. Other popular tools: - EventStore @link  'An industrial-strength database solution built from the ground up for event sourcing.' - Marten @link  '.NET Transactional Document DB and Event Store on PostgreSQL'"

Static code analysis works best when the following points are met: 1. Each developer has an IDE that respects the rules and helps to follow them 2.

1229,203892454,3,C#,"3.19 System Under Test SUT. There is always a need to prepare the entire system in a specific state, e.g. for manual, exploratory, UX / UI tests. The fact that the tests are performed manually does not mean that we cannot automate the preparation phase (Given / Arrange). Thanks to the automation of system state preparation (System Under Test @link ), we are able to recreate exactly the same state in any environment. In addition, such automation can be used later to automate the entire test (e.g. through an 3.13 Integration Tests(313-integration-tests)).. The implementation of such automation based on the use of NUKE and the test framework is presented below. As in the case of integration testing, we use the public API of modules. !(docs/Images/sut-preparation.jpg) Below is a SUT whose task is to go through the whole process - from setting up a Meeting Group, through its Payment, adding a new Meeting and signing up for it by another user. @Code You can create this SUT using following NUKE target providing connection string and particular test name: @Code"
1230,203892454,4,C#,"Description. Mutation testing is an approach to test and evaluate our existing tests. During mutation testing a special framework modifies pieces of our code and runs our tests. These modifications are called mutations or mutants. If a given mutation does not cause a failure of at least once test, it means that the mutant has survived so our tests are probably not sufficient."
1231,203892454,4,C#,"Example. In this repository, the Stryker.NET @link  framework was used for mutation testing. In the simplest use, after installation, all you need to do is enter the directory of tests that you want to mutate and run the following command: @Code The result of this command is the mutation report file. Assuming we want to test the unit tests of the Meetings module, such a report(docs/mutation-tests-reports/mutation-report.html) has been generated. This is its first page: !(docs/Images/mutation_testing_report.png) Let us analyze one of the places where the mutant survived. This is the AddNotAttendee method of the Meeting class. This method is used to add a Member to the list of people who have decided not to attend the meeting. According to the logic, if the same person previously indicated that he was going to the Meeting and later changed his mind, then if there is someone on the Waiting List, he should be added to the attendees. Based on requirements, this should be the person who signed up on the Waiting List first (based on SignUpDate). !(docs/Images/mutation_testing_example.png) As you can see, the mutation framework changed our sorting in linq query (from default ascending to descending). However, each test was successful, so it means that mutant survived so we don't have a test that checks the correct sort based on SignUpDate. From the example above, one more important thing can be deduced - code coverage is insufficient. In the given example, this code is covered, but our tests do not check the given requirement, therefore our code may have errors. Mutation testing allow to detect such situations. Of course, as with any tool, we should use it wisely, as not every case requires our attention."

Features Duplicati uses AES-256 encryption (or GNU Privacy Guard) to secure all data before it is uploaded. Duplicati uploads a full backup initially and stores smaller, incremental updates afterwards to save bandwidth and storage space. A scheduler keeps backups up-to-date automatically. Integrated updater notifies you when a new release is out Encrypted backup files are transferred to targets like FTP, Cloudfiles, WebDAV, SSH (SFTP), Amazon S3 and others. Duplicati allows backups of folders, document types like e.g. documents or images, or custom filter rules. Duplicati is available as application with an easy-to-use user interface and as command line tool. Duplicati can make proper backups of opened or locked files using the Volume Snapshot Service (VSS) under Windows or the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) under Linux. This allows Duplicati to back up the Microsoft Outlook PST file while Outlook is running. Filters, deletion rules, transfer and bandwidth options, etc Why use Duplicati? Keep your data safe, store it far away, update your backup regularly! This is a simple rule but many backup solutions do not achieve that today. But Duplicati does! Keep your data safe! Bad guys on the Internet seem to look for interesting data everywhere. But people do not want to see any of their private data revealed anywhere. Duplicati provides strong encryption to make sure that your data looks like garbage to others. With a well chosen password your backup files will be more safe on a public webserver than your unencrypted files at home. Store your backup far away! The best backup is useless when it is destroyed together with its original data. Just assume that a fire destroys your office - would your backup survive? Duplicati stores backups on various remote file servers and it supports incremental backups so that only changed parts need to be transferred. This makes it easy to use a destination far away from the original data. Backup regularly! The worst case is that your backup is outdated simply because someone forgot to make a backup at the right time. Duplicati has a built-in scheduler, so that it's easy to have a regular, up-to-date backup. Furthermore, Duplicati uses file compression and is able to store incremental backups to save storage space and bandwidth. Contributing"

We found a bunch of internal teams at Microsoft who were either building a reverse proxy for their service or had been asking about APIs and tech for building one, so we decided to get them all together to work on a common solution, this project. YARP is a reverse proxy toolkit for building fast proxy servers in .NET using the infrastructure from ASP.NET and .NET. The key differentiator for YARP is that it's been designed to be easily customized and tweaked to match the specific needs of each deployment scenario. We expect YARP to ship as a library and project template that together provide a robust, performant proxy server. Its pipeline and modules are designed so that you can then customize the functionality for your needs. For example, while YARP supports configuration files, we expect that many users will want to manage the configuration programmatically based on their own backend configuration management system, YARP will provide a configuration API to enable that customization in-proc.  YARP is designed with customizability as a primary scenario, rather than requiring you to break out to script or having to rebuild from source."

1350,28232663,3,C#,"Orleans is a cross-platform framework for building robust, scalable distributed applications. Orleans builds on the developer productivity of .NET and brings it to the world of distributed applications, such as cloud services. Orleans scales from a single on-premises server to globally distributed, highly-available applications in the cloud. Orleans takes familiar concepts like objects, interfaces, async/await, and try/catch and extends them to multi-server environments. As such, it helps developers experienced with single-server applications transition to building resilient, scalable cloud services and other distributed applications. For this reason, Orleans has often been referred to as 'Distributed .NET'. It was created by Microsoft Research @link  and introduced the Virtual Actor Model @link  as a novel approach to building a new generation of distributed systems for the Cloud era. The core contribution of Orleans is its programming model which tames the complexity inherent to highly-parallel distributed systems without restricting capabilities or imposing onerous constraints on the developer."
1351,28232663,2,C#,"Grains. The fundamental building block in any Orleans application is a grain. Grains are entities comprising user-defined identity, behavior, and state. Grain identities are user-defined keys which make Grains always available for invocation. Grains can be invoked by other grains or by external clients such as Web frontends, via strongly-typed communication interfaces (contracts). Each grain is an instance of a class which implements one or more of these interfaces. Grains can have volatile and/or persistent state that can be stored in any storage system. As such, grains implicitly partition application state, enabling automatic scalability and simplifying recovery from failures. Grain state is kept in memory while the grain is active, leading to lower latency and less load on data stores. Instantiation of grains is automatically performed on demand by the Orleans runtime. Grains which are not used for a while are automatically removed from memory to free up resources. This is possible because of their stable identity, which allows invoking grains whether they are already loaded into memory or not. This also allows for transparent recovery from failure because the caller does not need to know on which server a grain is instantiated on at any point in time. Grains have a managed lifecycle, with the Orleans runtime responsible for activating/deactivating, and placing/locating grains as needed. This allows the developer to write code as if all grains were always in-memory. Taken together, the stable identity, statefulness, and managed lifecycle of Grains are core factors that make systems built on Orleans scalable, performant, &amp; reliable without forcing developers to write complex distributed systems code."
1352,28232663,3,C#,"Example: IoT cloud backend. Consider a cloud backend for an Internet of Things @link  system. This application needs to process incoming device data, filter, aggregate, and process this information, and enable sending commands to devices. In Orleans, it is natural to model each device with a grain which becomes a digital twin of the physical device it corresponds to. These grains keep the latest device data in memory, so that they can be quickly queried and processed without the need to communicate with the physical device directly. By observing streams of time-series data from the device, the grain can detect changes in conditions, such as measurements exceeding a threshold, and trigger an action. A simple thermostat could be modeled as follows: @Code Events arriving from the thermostat from a Web frontend can be sent to its grain by invoking the OnUpdate method which optionally returns a command back to the device. @Code The same thermostat grain can implement a separate interface for control systems to interact with: @Code These two interfaces (IThermostat and IThermostatControl) are implemented by a single implementation class: @Code The Grain class above does not persist its state. A more thorough example demonstrating state persistence is available in the docs, for more information see Microsoft Orleans: Grain Persistence @link ."
1353,28232663,2,C#,"Orleans runtime. The Orleans runtime is what implements the programming model for applications. The main component of the runtime is the silo, which is responsible for hosting grains. Typically, a group of silos run as a cluster for scalability and fault-tolerance. When run as a cluster, silos coordinate with each other to distribute work, detect and recover from failures. The runtime enables grains hosted in the cluster to communicate with each other as if they are within a single process. In addition to the core programming model, the silo provides grains with a set of runtime services, such as timers, reminders (persistent timers), persistence, transactions, streams, and more. See the features section(features) below for more detail.. Web frontends and other external clients call grains in the cluster using the client library which automatically manages network communication. Clients can also be co-hosted in the same process with silos for simplicity. Orleans is compatible with .NET Standard 2.0 and above, running on Windows, Linux, and macOS, in full .NET Framework or .NET Core."
1354,28232663,2,C#,Features. Orleans is a feature-rich framework. It provides a set of services that enable the development of distributed systems. The following sections describe the features of Orleans.
1355,28232663,3,C#,"Persistence. Orleans provides a simple persistence model which ensures that state is available to a grain before requests are processed and that consistency is maintained. Grains can have multiple named persistent data objects, for example, one called 'profile' for a user's profile and one called 'inventory' for their inventory. This state can be stored in any storage system. For example, profile data may be stored in one database and inventory in another. While a grain is running, this state is kept in memory so that read requests can be served without accessing storage. When the grain updates its state, a state.WriteStateAsync() call ensures that the backing store is updated for durability and consistency. For more information see Microsoft Orleans: Grain Persistence @link ."
1356,28232663,3,C#,"Distributed ACID transactions. In addition to the simple persistence model described above, grains can have transactional state. Multiple grains can participate in ACID @link  transactions together regardless of where their state is ultimately stored. Transactions in Orleans are distributed and decentralized (there is no central transaction manager or transaction coordinator) and have serializable isolation @link Isolation_levels). For more information, see the Microsoft Orleans: Transactions @link .."
1357,28232663,3,C#,"Streams. Streams help developers to process series of data items in near-real time. Streams in Orleans are managed: streams do not need to be created or registered before a grain or client publishes to a stream or subscribes to a stream. This allows for greater decoupling of stream producers and consumers from each other and from the infrastructure. Stream processing is reliable: grains can store checkpoints (cursors) and reset to a stored checkpoint during activation or at any point afterwards. Streams supports batch delivery of messages to consumers to improve efficiency and recovery performance. Streams are backed by queueing services such as Azure Event Hubs, Amazon Kinesis, and others. An arbitrary number of streams can be multiplexed onto a smaller number of queues and the responsibility for processing these queues is balanced evenly across the cluster."
1358,28232663,3,C#,"Timers &amp; reminders. Reminders are a durable scheduling mechanism for grains. They can be used to ensure that some action is completed at a future point even if the grain is not currently activated at that time. Timers are the non-durable counterpart to reminders and can be used for high-frequency events which do not require reliability. For more information, see Microsoft Orleans: Timers and reminders @link ."
1359,28232663,3,C#,"Flexible grain placement. When a grain is activated in Orleans, the runtime decides which server (silo) to activate that grain on. This is called grain placement. The placement process in Orleans is fully configurable: developers can choose from a set of out-of-the-box placement policies such as random, prefer-local, and load-based, or custom logic can be configured. This allows for full flexibility in deciding where grains are created. For example, grains can be placed on a server close to resources which they need to operate on or other grains which they communicate with."
1360,28232663,3,C#,"Grain versioning &amp; heterogeneous clusters. Application code evolves over time and upgrading live, production systems in a manner which safely accounts for these changes can be challenging, particularly in stateful systems. Grain interfaces in Orleans can be optionally versioned. The cluster maintains a mapping of which grain implementations are available on which silos in the cluster and the versions of those implementations. This version information is used by the runtime in conjunction with placement strategies to make placement decisions when routing calls to grains. In addition to safe update of versioned grains, this also enables heterogeneous clusters, where different silos have different sets of grain implementations available. For more information, see Microsoft Orleans: Grain interface versioning @link ."
1361,28232663,3,C#,Elastic scalability &amp; fault tolerance. Orleans is designed to scale elastically. When a silo joins a cluster it is able to accept new activations and when a silo leaves the cluster (either because of scale down or a machine failure) the grains which were activated on that silo will be re-activated on remaining silos as needed. An Orleans cluster can be scaled down to a single silo. The same properties which enable elastic scalability also enable fault tolerance: the cluster automatically detects and quickly recovers from failures.
1362,28232663,3,C#,"Run anywhere. Orleans runs anywhere that .NET Core or .NET Framework are supported. This includes hosting on Linux, Windows, and macOS and deploying to Kubernetes, virtual or physical machines, on premises or in the cloud, and PaaS services such as Azure Cloud Services."
1363,28232663,3,C#,"Stateless workers. Stateless workers are specially marked grains which do not have any associated state and can be activated on multiple silos simultaneously. This enables increased parallelism for stateless functions. For more information, see Microsoft Orleans: Stateless worker grains @link  documentation."
1364,28232663,3,C#,"Grain call filters. Logic which is common to many grains can be expressed as an interceptor, or Grain call filter @link . Orleans supports filters for both incoming and outgoing calls. Some common use-cases of filters are: authorization, logging and telemetry, and error handling."

If you have found an issue with the client (choco.exe), you are in the right place. Keep reading below. Observe the following help for submitting an issue: Prerequisites: The issue has to do with choco itself and is not a package or website issue. Please check to see if your issue already exists with a quick search of the issues. Start with one relevant term and then add if you get too many results. You are not submitting an 'Enhancement'. Enhancements should observe CONTRIBUTING @link  guidelines. You are not submitting a question - questions are better served as emails @link  or Community Chat questions @link . Please make sure you've read over and agree with the etiquette regarding communication(etiquette-regarding-communication). . Submitting a ticket: We'll need debug and verbose output, so please run and capture the log with -dv or --debug --verbose. You can submit that with the issue or create a gist and link it. Please note that the debug/verbose output for some commands may have sensitive data (passwords or API keys) related to Chocolatey, so please remove those if they are there prior to submitting the issue. choco.exe logs to a file in $env:ChocolateyInstall\log\. You can grab the specific log output from there so you don't have to capture or redirect screen output. Please limit the amount included to just the command run (the log is appended to with every command). Please save the log output in a gist @link  (save the file as log.sh) and link to the gist from the issue. Feel free to create it as secret so it doesn't fill up against your public gists. Anyone with a direct link can still get to secret gists. If you accidentally include secret information in your gist, please delete it and create a new one (gist history can be seen by anyone) and update the link in the ticket (issue history is not retained except by email - deleting the gist ensures that no one can get to it). Using gists this way also keeps accidental secrets from being shared in the ticket in the first place as well. We'll need the entire log output from the run, so please don't limit it down to areas you feel are relevant. You may miss some important details we'll need to know. This will help expedite issue triage. It's helpful to include the version of choco, the version of the OS, and the version of PowerShell (Posh) - the debug script should capture all of those pieces of information. Include screenshots and/or animated gifs whenever possible, they help show us exactly what the problem is."

1429,334515155,3,C#,Where can we discuss it?. Please see the discussion here @link  for a worklog and conversation around this project.
1430,334515155,3,C#,"Project structure. I have moved all the original BASIC source code @link  into a folder for each project in the original book (first volume). Note that Lyle Kopnicky has generously normalized all the code (thanks Lyle!) to run against Vintage Basic @link  circa 2009: I’ve included all the games here for your tinkering pleasure. I’ve tested and tweaked each one of them to make sure they’ll run with Vintage BASIC, though you may see a few oddities. That’s part of the fun of playing with BASIC: it never works quite the same on two machines. The games will play better if you keep CAPS LOCK on, as they were designed to be used with capital-letter input. Each project has subfolders corresponding to the languages we’d like to see the games ported to. This is based on the 2022 TIOBE index of top languages @link  that are _memory safe_ and _general purpose scripting languages_ per this post @link : 1. C . 2. Java 3. JavaScript 4. Kotlin 5. Lua 6. Perl 7. Python 8. Ruby 9. Rust 10. VB.NET Note that in March 2022 we removed Pascal / Object Pascal and replaced it with Rust as we couldn’t determine if Pascal is effectively memory safe. We’ve also added Lua, as it made the top 20 in TIOBE (as of 2022) and it is both memory safe and a scripting language. The Pascal ports were moved to the alternate languages folder. Please note that we have decided, as a project, that we do not want any IDE-specific or build-specific files in the repository. Please refrain from committing any files to the repository that only exist to work with a specific IDE or a specific build system."
1431,334515155,3,C#,"Alternate Languages. If you wish to port one of the programs to a language not in our list – that is, a language which is either not memory safe, or not a general purpose scripting language, you can do so via the 00_Alternate_Languages folder. Place your port in the appropriate game subfolder, in a subfolder named for the language. Please note that these ports are appreciated, but they will not count toward the donation total at the end of the project."
1432,334515155,3,C#,"Project goals. Feel free to begin converting these classic games into the above list of modern, memory safe languages. In fact, courtesy of @mojoaxel, you can even view the JavaScript versions in your web browser at @link But first, a few guidelines: - These are very old games. They date from the mid-70s so they’re not exactly examples of what kids (or anyone, really?) would be playing these days. Consider them more like classic programming exercises to teach programming.  We’re paying it forward by converting them into modern languages, so the next generation can learn from the programs in this classic book – and compare implementations across common modern languages. - Stay true to the original program. These are mostly unsophisticated, simple command line / console games, so we should strive to replicate the command line / console output and behavior illustrated in the original book. See the README in the project folder for links to the original scanned source input and output. Try running the game in your browser @link . Avoid the impulse to add features; keep it simple, _except_ for modern conventions, see next item - Please DO update for modern coding conventions. Support uppercase and lowercase. Use structured programming. Use subroutines. Try to be an example of good, modern coding practices! - Use lots of comments to explain what is going on. Comment liberally! If there were clever tricks in the original code, decompose those tricks into simpler (even if more verbose) code, and use comments to explain what’s happening and why. If there is something particularly tricky about a program, edit the Porting Notes section of the readme.md to let everyone know. Those GOTOs can be very pesky.. - Please don’t get _too_ fancy. Definitely use the most recent versions and features of the target language, but also try to keep the code samples simple and explainable – the goal is to teach programming in the target language, not necessarily demonstrate the cleverest one-line tricks, or big system 'enterprise' coding techniques designed for thousands of lines of code. - Please don't check in any build specific or IDE specific files. We want the repository to be simple and clean, so we have ruled out including any IDE or build system specific files from the repository. Git related files are OK, as we are using Git and this is GitHub."
1433,334515155,3,C#,"Emulation and Bugfixes. We want the general behavior of the original programs to be preserved, _however_, we also want to update them, specifically: - allow both UPPERCASE and lowercase input and display - incorporate any bugfixes to the original programs; see the readme.md in the game folder - improved error handling for bad or erroneous input Please note that on the back of the Basic Computer Games book it says Microsoft 8K Basic, Rev 4.0 was the version David Ahl used to test, so that is the level of compatibility we are looking for.  QBasic on the DOS emulation is a later version of Basic but one that retains downwards compatibility so far in our testing. To verify behavior, try running the programs in your browser @link  with JS BASIC, effectively Applesoft BASIC @link ."

1443,36990723,3,C#,The Great C Example. @Code
1444,36990723,3,C#,"Locales. Since we're a port of faker.js, we support a whole bunch of different locales. Here's an example in Korean: @Code Bogus supports the following locales: Note: Some locales may not have a complete data set. For example, zh_CN @link  does not have a lorem data set, but ko @link  has a lorem data set. Bogus will default to en if a locale-specific data set is not found. To further illustrate the previous example, the missing zh_CN:lorem data set will default to the en:lorem data set. If you'd like to help contribute new locales or update existing ones please see our Creating Locales @link  wiki page for more info."

1459,36990723,3,C#,"Determinism. Determinism is a first class concept in Bogus. Bogus goes to great lengths so developers can generate the same sequence of data over multiple program executions. Bogus has two strategies of setting up deterministic behavior: 1. Global Seed determinism through the Randomizer.Seed global static property. Pros: Easy to get deterministic data setup quickly. Cons: Code changes can impact other data values. Not so good for unit tests. 2. Local Seed determinism through instance properties and methods. Specifically, The Faker.UseSeed(int) method. The .Random property on the Faker facade and DataSets. Pros: Code changes can be isolated with minimal impact on determinism. Good for unit tests. Cons: Requires some forethought in design. When Local Seed determinism is used to set a seed value, the global static source of randomness is ignored. This has some interesting implications as described below."
1460,36990723,4,C#,"Using Global Seed determinism. The easiest way to get deterministic data values over multiple executions of a program is to set the Randomizer.Seed property as demonstrated below: @Code Re-running the code above with 1338 as a global static seed value will produce the same table of data over and over again. Next, add a new Description property to the Order class along with a new .RuleFor(o  o.Description, ..) rule and see the data changes: @Code A couple of observations: Order 0: Item value Fish remained the same. Order 0: Quantity changed from 3 to 1. Order 1: Item has changed from a Chair to a Keyboard. In fact, every data value with a :triangular_flag_on_post: icon has changed. This is due to the newly added property which has the effect of shifting the entire global static pseudo-random sequence off by 1. This rippling effect can be a problem if unit tests are expecting data values to remain the same. The following section below shows how we can improve the situation."
1461,36990723,4,C#,"Using Local Seed determinism. Making use of the Faker.UseSeed(int) method can help limit the impact of POCO schema changes on deterministic data values that span across an entire run. Consider the following code that uses a seed value for each instance of a POCO object: @Code Next, adding the Description property to the Order class and examining the output: @Code Progress! This time only the Quantity data values with the :triangular_flag_on_post: icon have changed. The Item column remained the same before and after the new addition of the Description property. We can further prevent the Quantity data values from changing by moving the RuleFor(o  o.Description,...) rule line to the end of the Faker declaration as shown below: @Code Much success! :100: :tada: The Item and Quantity values remain unchanged! The new Description property is added to the POCO object without any impact to other deterministic data values. As a best practice, to achieve maximum deterministic behavior and unit test robustness with Bogus: :heavy_check_mark: Add new RuleFor rules last in Faker declarations. :heavy_check_mark: Avoid changing existing rules. :heavy_check_mark: Always use Faker.UseSeed(int) to avoid using the global static seed as a source for randomness. :heavy_check_mark: When possible assert that a value exists, not the literal value itself. In other words, @Code ------- The Faker facade and individual DataSets can also be prepared to use local seeds as well. The following shows how to set up the Faker facade and DataSets to use local seeds: @Code The .Random property can be set multiple times without any ill effects."
1462,36990723,4,C#,"Versioning can effect determinism. Updating to new versions of Bogus on NuGet can effect determinism too. For example, when Bogus updates locales from faker.js or issues bug fixes, sometimes deterministic sequences can change. Changes to deterministic outputs are usually highlighted in the release notes @link . Changes to deterministic outputs is also considered a breaking change. Bogus generally follows semantic versioning rules. For example: As a general rule of thumb, :heavy_check_mark: For maximum stability for unit tests, stay within the same major versions of Bogus. :heavy_check_mark: For those wanting to stay up to date, assert that a value exists, not a literal value itself. In other words, @Code"
1463,36990723,4,C#,"Deterministic Dates and Times. Bogus can generate deterministic dates and times. However, generating deterministic dates and times requires the following: 1. Setting up a seed value(determinism).. 1. Setting up a time reference for your Faker object instance. The following code shows how to setup deterministic dates and times: @Code With a time reference set and a seed(determinism), dates and times should be deterministic across multiple runs of a program..

What RestSharp adds to HttpClient: - Default parameters of any kind, not just headers - Add a parameter of any kind to requests, like query, URL segment, header, cookie, or body - Multiple ways to add a request body, including JSON, XML, URL-encoded form data, multipart form data with and without files - Built-in serialization and deserilization of JSON, XML, and CSV, as well as the ability to add custom serializers - Rich support for authentication"
1471,374228,2,C#,"Compatibility note. RestSharp 107 was a major release that brings a lot of changes. We've removed a lot of legacy code and added new features. Finally, RestSharp has moved to HttpClient. We also deprecated the following: - SimpleJson in favour of System.Text.Json.JsonSerialzer - IRestRequest, and IRestResponse in favour of implementing classes - Everything Http and IHttp as those are just wrappers - Client configuration moved to RestClientOptions to make the client thread-safe - IRestClient interface surface substantially reduced Most of the client and some of the request options are now in RestClientOptions.

Unlike Idle Master which works only for one account at given time, while requiring Steam client running in the background and launching additional processes imitating 'game playing' status, ASF doesn't require any Steam client running in the background, doesn't launch any additional processes and is made to handle unlimited Steam accounts at once. In addition to that, it's meant to be run on servers or other desktop-less machines, and features full cross-OS support, which makes it possible to launch on any operating system with .NET Core runtime, such as Windows, Linux and macOS. ASF is possible thanks to gigantic amount of work done in marvelous SteamKit2 @link  library.. Today, ASF is one of the most versatile Steam power tools, allowing you to make use of many features that were implemented over time. Apart from farming Steam cards, which remains the primary focus, ASF includes bunch of features on its own, such as a possibility to use it as Steam authenticator or chat logger.

1639,62256097,2,C#,"About . Ocelot is a .NET API Gateway. This project is aimed at people using .NET running a microservices / service-oriented architecture that need a unified point of entry into their system. However it will work with anything that speaks HTTP(S) and run on any platform that ASP.NET Core supports. In particular we want easy integration with IdentityServer @link  reference and Bearer @link  tokens. We have been unable to find this in our current workplace without having to write our own Javascript middlewares to handle the IdentityServer reference tokens. We would rather use the IdentityServer code that already exists to do this. Ocelot is a bunch of middlewares in a specific order. Ocelot manipulates the HttpRequest object into a state specified by its configuration until it reaches a request builder middleware, where it creates a HttpRequestMessage object which is used to make a request to a downstream service. The middleware that makes the request is the last thing in the Ocelot pipeline. It does not call the next middleware. The response from the downstream service is retrieved as the requests goes back up the Ocelot pipeline. There is a piece of middleware that maps the HttpResponseMessage onto the HttpResponse object and that is returned to the client. That is basically it with a bunch of other features!"

1675,681372871,1,C#,"Garnet. @link @link Garnet is a new remote cache-store from Microsoft Research, that offers several unique benefits: Garnet adopts the popular RESP @link  wire protocol as a starting point, which makes it possible to use Garnet from unmodified Redis clients available in most programming languages of today, such as StackExchange.Redis @link  in C.. Garnet offers much better throughput and scalability with many client connections and small batches, relative to comparable open-source cache-stores, leading to cost savings for large apps and services. Garnet demonstrates extremely low client latencies (often less than 300 microseconds at the 99.9th percentile) using commodity cloud (Azure) VMs with Accelerated Networking enabled, which is critical to real-world scenarios. Based on the latest .NET technology, Garnet is cross-platform, extensible, and modern. It is designed to be easy to develop for and evolve, without sacrificing performance in the common case. We leveraged the rich library ecosystem of .NET for API breadth, with open opportunities for optimization. Thanks to our careful use of .NET, Garnet achieves state-of-the-art performance on both Linux and Windows. This repo contains the code to build and run Garnet. For more information and documentation, check out our website at  @link @link ."
1676,681372871,2,C#,"Feature Summary. Garnet implements a wide range of APIs including raw strings (e.g., gets, sets, and key expiration), analytical (e.g., HyperLogLog and Bitmap), and object (e.g., sorted sets and lists) operations. It can handle multi-key transactions in the form of client-side RESP transactions and our own server-side stored procedures in C and allows users to define custom. operations on both raw strings and new object types, all in the convenience and safety of C, leading to a lower bar for developing custom extensions.. Garnet uses a fast and pluggable network layer, enabling future extensions such as leveraging kernel-bypass stacks. It supports secure transport layer security (TLS) communications using the robust SslStream @link  library of .NET, as well as basic access control. Garnet’s storage layer, called Tsavorite, was forked from our prior open-source project FASTER @link , and includes strong database features such as thread scalability, tiered storage support (memory, SSD, and cloud storage), fast non-blocking checkpointing, recovery, operation logging for durability, multi-key transaction support, and better memory management and reuse. Finally, Garnet supports a cluster mode of operation with support for sharding, replication, and dynamic key migration."
1677,681372871,2,C#,Performance Preview. We illustrate a few key results on our website @link  comparing Garnet to leading open-source cache-stores.
1678,681372871,2,C#,"Design Highlights. Garnet’s design re-thinks the entire cache-store stack – from receiving packets on the network, to parsing and processing database operations, to performing storage interactions. We build on top of years of our prior research @link . Below is Garnet’s overall architecture. Garnet’s network layer inherits a shared memory design inspired by our prior research on ShadowFax @link . TLS processing and storage interactions are performed on the IO completion thread, avoiding thread switching overheads in the common case. This approach allows CPU cache coherence to bring the data to the network, instead of traditional shuffle-based designs, which require data movement on the server. Garnet’s storage design consists of two Tsavorite key-value stores whose fates are bound by a unified operation log. The first store, called the “main store,” is optimized for raw string operations and manages memory carefully to avoid garbage collection. The second, and optional, “object store” is optimized for complex objects and custom data types, including popular types such as Sorted Set, Set, Hash, List, and Geo. Data types in the object store leverage the .NET library ecosystem for their current implementations. They are stored on the heap in memory (which makes updates very efficient) and in a serialized form on disk. In the future, we plan to investigate using a unified index and log to ease maintenance. A distinguishing feature of Garnet’s design is its narrow-waist Tsavorite storage API, which is used to implement the large, rich, and extensible RESP API surface on top. This API consists of read, upsert, delete, and atomic read-modify-write operations, implemented with asynchronous callbacks for Garnet to interject logic at various points during each operation. Our storage API model allows us to cleanly separate Garnet’s parsing and query processing concerns from storage details such as concurrency, storage tiering, and checkpointing. Garnet uses two-phase locking for multi-key transactions."
1679,681372871,3,C#,"Cluster Mode. In addition to single-node execution, Garnet supports a cluster mode, which allows users to create and manage a sharded and replicated deployment. Garnet also supports an efficient and dynamic key migration scheme to rebalance shards. Users can use standard Redis cluster commands to create and manage Garnet clusters, and nodes perform gossip to share and evolve cluster state. Cluster is still work in progress."

1685,69662720,1,C#,"WaveFunctionCollapse. This program generates bitmaps that are locally similar to the input bitmap. Local similarity means that (C1) The output should contain only those NxN patterns of pixels that are present in the input. (Weak C2) Distribution of NxN patterns in the input should be similar to the distribution of NxN patterns over a sufficiently large number of outputs. In other words, probability to meet a particular pattern in the output should be close to the density of such patterns in the input. In the examples a typical value of N is 3. WFC initializes output bitmap in a completely unobserved state, where each pixel value is in superposition of colors of the input bitmap (so if the input was black & white then the unobserved states are shown in different shades of grey). The coefficients in these superpositions are real numbers, not complex numbers, so it doesn't do the actual quantum mechanics, but it was inspired by QM. Then the program goes into the observation-propagation cycle: On each observation step an NxN region is chosen among the unobserved which has the lowest Shannon entropy. This region's state then collapses into a definite state according to its coefficients and the distribution of NxN patterns in the input. On each propagation step new information gained from the collapse on the previous step propagates through the output. On each step the number of non-zero coefficients decreases and in the end we have a completely observed state, the wave function has collapsed. It may happen that during propagation all the coefficients for a certain pixel become zero. That means that the algorithm has run into a contradiction and can not continue. The problem of determining whether a certain bitmap allows other nontrivial bitmaps satisfying condition (C1) is NP-hard, so it's impossible to create a fast solution that always finishes. In practice, however, the algorithm runs into contradictions surprisingly rarely.

1686,69662720,2,C#,"Algorithm. 1. Read the input bitmap and count NxN patterns. 1. (optional) Augment pattern data with rotations and reflections. 2. Create an array with the dimensions of the output (called 'wave' in the source). Each element of this array represents a state of an NxN region in the output. A state of an NxN region is a superposition of NxN patterns of the input with boolean coefficients (so a state of a pixel in the output is a superposition of input colors with real coefficients). False coefficient means that the corresponding pattern is forbidden, true coefficient means that the corresponding pattern is not yet forbidden. 3. Initialize the wave in the completely unobserved state, i.e. with all the boolean coefficients being true. 4. Repeat the following steps: 1. Observation: 1. Find a wave element with the minimal nonzero entropy. If there is no such elements (if all elements have zero or undefined entropy) then break the cycle (4) and go to step (5). 2. Collapse this element into a definite state according to its coefficients and the distribution of NxN patterns in the input. 2. Propagation: propagate information gained on the previous observation step. 5. By now all the wave elements are either in a completely observed state (all the coefficients except one being zero) or in the contradictory state (all the coefficients being zero). In the first case return the output. In the second case finish the work without returning anything."
1687,69662720,2,C#,"Tilemap generation. The simplest nontrivial case of the algorithm is when NxN1x2 (well, NxM). If we simplify it even further by storing not the probabilities of pairs of colors but the probabilities of colors themselves, we get what we call a 'simple tiled model'. The propagation phase in this model is just adjacency constraint propagation. It's convenient to initialize the simple tiled model with a list of tiles and their adjacency data (adjacency data can be viewed as a large set of very small samples) rather than a sample bitmap. GIF   GIFV -- Lists of all the possible pairs of adjacent tiles in practical tilesets can be quite long, so I implemented a symmetry system for tiles to shorten the enumeration. In this system each tile should be assigned with its symmetry type. Note that the tiles have the same symmetry type as their assigned letters (or, in other words, actions of the dihedral group D4 are isomorphic for tiles and their corresponding letters). With this system it's enough to enumerate pairs of adjacent tiles only up to symmetry, which makes lists of adjacencies for tilesets with many symmetrical tiles (even the summer tileset, despite drawings not being symmetrical the system considers such tiles to be symmetrical) several times shorter. Note that the unrestrained knot tileset (with all 5 tiles being allowed) is not interesting for WFC, because you can't run into a situation where you can't place a tile. We call tilesets with this property 'easy'. Without special heuristics easy tilesets don't produce interesting global arrangements, because correlations of tiles in easy tilesets quickly fall off with a distance. Many easy tilesets can be found on Guy Walker's website @link . Consider the 'Dual' 2-edge tileset there. How can it generate knots (without t-junctions, not easy) while being easy? The answer is, it can only generate a narrow class of knots, it can't produce an arbitrary knot. Note also that Circuit, Summer and Rooms tilesets are non-Wang. That is, their adjacency data cannot be induced from edge labels. For example, in Circuit two Corners cannot be adjacent, yet they can be connected with a Connection tile, and diagonal tracks cannot change direction."
1688,69662720,2,C#,"Higher dimensions. WFC algorithm in higher dimensions works completely the same way as in dimension 2, though performance becomes an issue.

1689,69662720,2,C#,"Constrained synthesis. WFC algorithm supports constraints. Therefore, it can be easily combined with other generative algorithms or with manual creation. Here is WFC autocompleting a level started by a human: GIF   GIFV -- ConvChain @link  algorithm satisfies the strong version of the condition (C2): the limit distribution of NxN patterns in the outputs it is producing is exactly the same as the distributions of patterns in the input. However, ConvChain doesn't satisfy (C1): it often produces noticeable defects. It makes sense to run ConvChain first to get a well-sampled configuration and then run WFC to correct local defects. This is similar to a common strategy in optimization: first run a Monte-Carlo method to find a point close to a global optimum and then run a gradient descent from that point for greater accuracy. P. F. Harrison's texture synthesis @link  algorithm is significantly faster than WFC, but it has trouble with long correlations (for example, it's difficult for this algorithm to synthesize brick wall textures with correctly aligned bricks). But this is exactly where WFC shines, and Harrison's algorithm supports constraints. It makes sense first to generate a perfect brick wall blueprint with WFC and then run a constrained texture synthesis algorithm on that blueprint."
1690,69662720,2,C#,"Comments. Why the minimal entropy heuristic? I noticed that when humans draw something they often follow the minimal entropy heuristic(images/lowest-entropy-heuristic.gif) themselves. That's why the algorithm is so enjoyable to watch. The overlapping model relates to the simple tiled model the same way higher order Markov chains relate to order one Markov chains. WFC's propagation phase is very similar to the loopy belief propagation algorithm. In fact, I first programmed belief propagation, but then switched to constraint propagation with a saved stationary distribution, because BP is significantly slower without a massive parallelization (on a CPU) and didn't produce significantly better results in my problems. Note that the 'Simple Knot' and 'Trick Knot' samples have 3 colors, not 2. One of the dimensions can be time. In particular, d-dimensional WFC captures the behaviour of any (d-1)-dimensional cellular automata."

Compared to the earlier texture synthesis algorithms, WFC guarantees that the output contains only those NxN patterns that are present in the input. This makes WFC perfect for level generation in games and pixel art, and less suited for large full-color textures. 2. Paul C. Merrell, Model Synthesis @link , 2009. Merrell derives adjacency constraints between tiles from an example model and generates a new larger model with the AC-3 algorithm. We generalize his approach to work with NxN overlapping patterns of tiles instead of individual tiles. This allows to use a single image as the input to the algorithm. By varying N, we can make the output look more like the input or less. We introduce the lowest entropy heuristic(images/lowest-entropy-heuristic.gif) that removes the directional bias(images/directional-bias.png) in generated results, is defined for irregular grids and is better suited for pre-constrained problems(images/constrained.gif). We implement a tile symmetry system to reduce the sizes of inputs. We visualize partially observed states, either with color averaging(images/wfc.gif) or per-voxel voting @link .

Feel free to contact me @link  if you'd like information about upcoming workshops."
1711,69673033,1,C#,"Design Decisions and Dependencies. The goal of this sample is to provide a fairly bare-bones starter kit for new projects. It does not include every possible framework, tool, or feature that a particular enterprise application might benefit from. Its choices of technology for things like data access are rooted in what is the most common, accessible technology for most business software developers using Microsoft's technology stack. It doesn't (currently) include extensive support for things like logging, monitoring, or analytics, though these can all be added easily. Below is a list of the technology dependencies it includes, and why they were chosen. Most of these can easily be swapped out for your technology of choice, since the nature of this architecture is to support modularity and encapsulation."
1712,69673033,2,C#,"Where To Validate. Validation of user input is a requirement of all software applications. The question is, where does it make sense to implement it in a concise and elegant manner? This solution template includes 4 separate projects, each of which might be responsible for performing validation as well as enforcing business invariants (which, given validation should already have occurred, are usually modeled as exceptions). The domain model itself should generally rely on object-oriented design to ensure it is always in a consistent state. It leverages encapsulation and limits public state mutation access to achieve this, and it assumes that any arguments passed to it have already been validated, so null or other improper values yield exceptions, not validation results, in most cases. The use cases / application project includes the set of all commands and queries the system supports. It's frequently responsible for validating its own command and query objects. The Web project includes all API endpoints, which include their own request and response types, following the REPR pattern @link . The FastEndpoints library includes built-in support for validation using FluentValidation on the request types. This is a natural place to perform input validation as well. Having validation occur both within the API endpoints and then again at the use case level is redundant, so in this template the choice has been made to validate at the edge of the application, in the API endpoints. This means some future consumer of the Use Cases project will also need to be responsible for its own validation as well, but in the vast majority of cases there won't be any other consumers of the use cases outside of the API endpoints."
1713,69673033,2,C#,"The Core Project. The Core project is the center of the Clean Architecture design, and all other project dependencies should point toward it. As such, it has very few external dependencies. The Core project should include the Domain Model including things like: - Entities - Aggregates - Value Objects - Domain Events - Domain Event Handlers - Domain Services - Specifications - Interfaces - DTOs (sometimes)"
1714,69673033,2,C#,"The Use Cases Project. An optional project, I've included it because many folks were demanding it and it's easier to remove than to add later. This is also often referred to as the Application or Application Services layer. The Use Cases project is organized following CQRS into Commands and Queries. Commands mutate the domain model and thus should always use Repository abstractions for their data access. Queries are readonly, and thus do not need to use the repository pattern, but instead can use whatever query service or approach is most convenient. However, since the Use Cases project is set up to depend on Core and not directly on Infrastructure, there will still need to be abstractions defined for its data access. And it can use things like specifications, which can sometimes help encapsulate query logic as well as result type mapping. But it doesn't have to use repository/specification - it can just issue a SQL query or call a stored procedure if that's the most efficient way to get the data. Although this is an optional project to include (without it, your API endpoints would just work directly with the domain model or query services), it does provide a nice UI-ignorant place to add automated tests."
1715,69673033,2,C#,"The Infrastructure Project. Most of your application's dependencies on external resources should be implemented in classes defined in the Infrastructure project. These classes should implement interfaces defined in Core. If you have a very large project with many dependencies, it may make sense to have multiple Infrastructure projects (e.g. Infrastructure.Data), but for most projects one Infrastructure project with folders works fine. The sample includes data access and domain event implementations, but you would also add things like email providers, file access, web api clients, etc. to this project so they're not adding coupling to your Core or UI projects. The Infrastructure project depends on Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer and Autofac. The former is used because it's built into the default ASP.NET Core templates and is the least common denominator of data access. If desired, it can easily be replaced with a lighter-weight ORM like Dapper. Autofac (formerly StructureMap) is used to allow wireup of dependencies to take place closest to where the implementations reside. In this case, an InfrastructureRegistry class can be used in the Infrastructure class to allow wireup of dependencies there, without the entry point of the application even having to have a reference to the project or its types. Learn more about this technique @link . The current implementation doesn't include this behavior - it's something I typically cover and have students add themselves in my workshops."
1716,69673033,2,C#,"The Web Project. The entry point of the application is the ASP.NET Core web project. This is actually a console application, with a public static void Main method in Program.cs. It currently uses the default MVC organization (Controllers and Views folders) as well as most of the default ASP.NET Core project template code. This includes its configuration system, which uses the default appsettings.json file plus environment variables, and is configured in Startup.cs. The project delegates to the Infrastructure project to wire up its services using Autofac."
1717,69673033,2,C#,"The SharedKernel Project. Many solutions will also reference a separate Shared Kernel project/package. I recommend creating a separate SharedKernel project and solution if you will require sharing code between multiple bounded contexts @link  (see DDD Fundamentals @link ). I further recommend this be published as a NuGet package (most likely privately within your organization) and referenced as a NuGet dependency by those projects that require it. Previously a project for SharedKernel was included in this project. However, for the above reasons I've made it a separate package, Ardalis.SharedKernel @link , which you should replace with your own when you use this template. If you want to see another example of a SharedKernel package, the one I use in my updated Pluralsight DDD course is on NuGet here @link ."
1718,69673033,2,C#,"The Test Projects. Test projects could be organized based on the kind of test (unit, functional, integration, performance, etc.) or by the project they are testing (Core, Infrastructure, Web), or both. For this simple starter kit, the test projects are organized based on the kind of test, with unit, functional and integration test projects existing in this solution. In terms of dependencies, there are three worth noting: - xunit @link  I'm using xunit because that's what ASP.NET Core uses internally to test the product. It works great and as new versions of ASP.NET Core ship, I'm confident it will continue to work well with it. - NSubstitute @link  I'm using NSubstitute as a mocking framework for white box behavior-based tests. If I have a method that, under certain circumstances, should perform an action that isn't evident from the object's observable state, mocks provide a way to test that. I could also use my own Fake implementation, but that requires a lot more typing and files. NSubstitute is great once you get the hang of it, and assuming you don't have to mock the world (which we don't in this case because of good, modular design). - Microsoft.AspNetCore.TestHost @link  I'm using TestHost to test my web project using its full stack, not just unit testing action methods. Using TestHost, you make actual HttpClient requests without going over the wire (so no firewall or port configuration issues). Tests run in memory and are very fast, and requests exercise the full MVC stack, including routing, model binding, model validation, filters, etc."

1720,69673033,2,C#,"Domain Events. Domain events are a great pattern for decoupling a trigger for an operation from its implementation. This is especially useful from within domain entities since the handlers of the events can have dependencies while the entities themselves typically do not. In the sample, you can see this in action with the ToDoItem.MarkComplete() method. The following sequence diagram demonstrates how the event and its handler are used when an item is marked complete through a web API endpoint."

1761,75990888,1,C#,"C Language Design. @link   @link Welcome to the official repo for C language design. This is where new C language features are developed, adopted and specified.. C is designed by the C Language Design Team (LDT) in close coordination with the Roslyn @link  project, which implements the language.. You can find: - Active C language feature proposals in the proposals folder(proposals). - Notes from C language design meetings in the meetings folder(meetings). - Full C 6 language specification (draft) in the spec folder(spec). - Summary of the language version history here(Language-Version-History.md). If you discover bugs or deficiencies in the above, please leave an issue to raise them, or even better: a pull request to fix them. For new feature proposals, however, please raise them for discussion @link , and only submit a proposal as a pull request if invited to do so by a member of the Language Design Team (a 'champion')."
1762,75990888,2,C#,"Discussions. Debate pertaining to language features takes place in the form of Discussions @link  in this repo. If you want to suggest a feature, discuss current design notes or proposals, etc., please open a new Discussion topic @link . Discussions that are short and stay on topic are much more likely to be read. If you leave comment number fifty, chances are that only a few people will read it. To make discussions easier to navigate and benefit from, please observe a few rules of thumb: - Discussion should be relevant to C language design. If they are not, they will be summarily closed.. - Choose a descriptive topic that clearly communicates the scope of discussion. - Stick to the topic of the discussion. If a comment is tangential, or goes into detail on a subtopic, start a new discussion and link back. - Is your comment useful for others to read, or can it be adequately expressed with an emoji reaction to an existing comment? Language proposals which prevent specific syntax from occurring can be achieved with a Roslyn analyzer @link . Proposals that only make existing syntax optionally illegal will be rejected by the language design committee to prevent increased language complexity."
1763,75990888,2,C#,"Proposals. Once you have a fully fleshed out proposal describing a new language feature in syntactic and semantic detail, please open an issue for it @link , and it will be labeled as a Proposal @link . The comment thread on the issue can be used to hash out or briefly discuss details of the proposal, as well as pros and cons of adopting it into C. If an issue does not meet the bar of being a full proposal, we may move it to a discussion, so that it can be 'baked' further. Specific open issues or more expansive discussion with a proposal will often warrant opening a side discussion rather than cluttering the comment section on the issue.. When a member of the C LDM finds that a proposal merits discussion, they can Champion @link  it, which means that they will bring it to the C Language Design Meeting. If the LDM decides to work on adopting the feature, the proposer, the champion and others can collaborate on adding it as a document to the Proposals(proposals) folder, where its evolution can be tracked over time.."
1764,75990888,2,C#,"Design Process. Proposals(proposals) evolve as a result of decisions in Language Design Meetings(meetings), which are informed by discussions @link , experiments, and offline design work. In many cases it will be necessary to implement and share a prototype of a feature in order to land on the right design, and ultimately decide whether to adopt the feature. Prototypes help discover both implementation and usability issues of a feature. A prototype should be implemented in a fork of the Roslyn repo @link  and meet the following bar: - Parsing (if applicable) should be resilient to experimentation: typing should not cause crashes. - Include minimal tests demonstrating the feature at work end-to-end. - Include minimal IDE support (keyword coloring, formatting, completion). Once approved, a feature should be fully implemented in Roslyn @link , and fully specified in the language specification(spec), whereupon the proposal is moved into the appropriate folder for a completed feature, e.g. C 7.1 proposals(proposals/csharp-7.1).. DISCLAIMER: An active proposal is under active consideration for inclusion into a future version of the C programming language but is not in any way guaranteed to ultimately be included in the next or any version of the language. A proposal may be postponed or rejected at any time during any phase of the above process based on feedback from the design team, community, code reviewers, or testing.."
1765,75990888,3,C#,"Milestones. We have a few different milestones for issues on the repo: Working Set @link  is the set of championed proposals that are currently being actively worked on. Not everything in this milestone will make the next version of C, but it will get design time during the upcoming release.. Backlog @link  is the set of championed proposals that have been triaged, but are not being actively worked on. While discussion and ideas from the community are welcomed on these proposals, the cost of the design work and implementation review on these features are too high for us to consider community implementation until we are ready for it. Any Time @link  is the set of championed proposals that have been triaged, but are not being actively worked on and are open to community implementation. Issues in this can be in one of 2 states: needs approved specification, and needs implementation. Those that need a specification still need to be presented during LDM for approval of the spec, but we are willing to take the time to do so at our earliest convenience. Likely Never @link  is the set of proposals that the LDM has rejected from the language. Without strong need or community feedback, these proposals will not be considered in the future. Numbered milestones are the set of features that have been implemented for that particular language version. For closed milestones, these are the set of things that shipped with that release. For open milestones, features can be potentially pulled later if we discover compatibility or other issues as we near release."

Note that building from Git assumes that you already have Mono installed, so please download and install the latest Mono release @link before trying to build from Git. This is required because the Mono build relies on a working Mono C compiler to compile itself. (also known as bootstrapping @link )). If you don't have a working Mono installation --------------------------------------------- If you don't have a working Mono installation, you can try a slightly more risky approach: getting the latest version of the 'monolite' distribution, which contains just enough to run the 'mcs' compiler. You do this with:"
1789,791611,1,C#,"Run the following line after ./autogen.sh. make get-monolite-latest This will download and place the files appropriately so that you can then just run: make The build will then use the files downloaded by make get-monolite-latest.

As a sanity check, you can compare the failures you got with  @link @link . You can now install mono with: make install You can verify your installation by using the mono-test-install script, it can diagnose some common problems with Mono's install.

Reporting bugs To submit bug reports, please open an issue on the mono GitHub repo @link . Please use the search facility to ensure the same bug hasn't already been submitted and follow our guidelines @link on how to make a good bug report. Configuration Options The following are the configuration options that someone building Mono might want to use: --with-sgenyes,no - Generational GC support: Used to enable or disable the compilation of a Mono runtime with the SGen garbage collector. On platforms that support it, after building Mono, you will have both a mono-boehm binary and a mono-sgen binary. mono-boehm uses Boehm, while mono-sgen uses the Simple Generational GC. --with-libgcincluded, none - Selects the default Boehm garbage collector engine to use. included: (slightly modified Boehm GC) This is the default value for the Boehm GC, and it's the most feature complete, it will allow Mono to use typed allocations and support the debugger. none: Disables the inclusion of a Boehm garbage collector. This defaults to included. --enable-cooperative-suspend If you pass this flag the Mono runtime is configured to only use the cooperative mode of the garbage collector.  If you do not pass this flag, then you can control at runtime the use of the cooperative GC mode by setting the MONO_ENABLE_COOP_SUSPEND flag. --with-tls__thread,pthread Controls how Mono should access thread local storage, pthread forces Mono to use the pthread APIs, while __thread uses compiler-optimized access to it. Although __thread is faster, it requires support from the compiler, kernel and libc. Old Linux systems do not support with __thread. This value is typically pre-configured and there is no need to set it, unless you are trying to debug a problem. --with-sigaltstackyes,no Experimental: Use at your own risk, it is known to cause problems with garbage collection and is hard to reproduce those bugs. This controls whether Mono will install a special signal handler to handle stack overflows. If set to yes, it will turn stack overflows into the StackOverflowException. Otherwise when a stack overflow happens, your program will receive a segmentation fault. The configure script will try to detect if your operating system supports this. Some older Linux systems do not support this feature, or you might want to override the auto-detection. --with-static_monoyes,no This controls whether mono should link against a static library (libmono.a) or a shared library (libmono.so). This defaults to yes, and will improve the performance of the mono program. This only affects the mono' binary, the shared library libmono.so will always be produced for developers that want to embed the runtime in their application. --with-xen-optyes,no - Optimize code for Xen virtualization. It makes Mono generate code which might be slightly slower on average systems, but the resulting executable will run faster under the Xen virtualization system. This defaults to yes. --with-large-heapyes,no - Enable support for GC heaps larger than 3GB. This only applies only to the Boehm garbage collector, the SGen garbage collector does not use this configuration option. This defaults to no. --enable-small-configyes,no - Enable some tweaks to reduce memory usage and disk footprint at the expense of some capabilities. Typically this means that the number of threads that can be created is limited (256), that the maximum heap size is also reduced (256 MB) and other such limitations that still make mono useful, but more suitable to embedded devices (like mobile phones). This defaults to no. --with-ikvm-nativeyes,no - Controls whether the IKVM JNI interface library is built or not. This is used if you are planning on using the IKVM Java Virtual machine with Mono. This defaults to yes. --with-profile4yes,no - Whether you want to build the 4.x profile libraries and runtime. This defaults to yes. --with-libgdiplusinstalled,sibling, - Configure where Mono searches for libgdiplus when running System.Drawing tests. It defaults to installed, which means that the library is available to Mono through the regular system setup. sibling can be used to specify that a libgdiplus that resides as a sibling of this directory (mono) should be used. Or you can specify a path to a libgdiplus. --enable-minimalLIST Use this feature to specify optional runtime components that you might not want to include.  This is only useful for developers embedding Mono that require a subset of Mono functionality. The list is a comma-separated list of components that should be removed, these are: aot: Disables support for the Ahead of Time compilation. attach: Support for the Mono.Management assembly and the VMAttach API (allowing code to be injected into a target VM) com: Disables COM support. debug: Drop debugging support. decimal: Disables support for System.Decimal. full_messages: By default Mono comes with a full table of messages for error codes. This feature turns off uncommon error messages and reduces the runtime size. generics: Generics support.  Disabling this will not allow Mono to run any 2.0 libraries or code that contains generics. jit: Removes the JIT engine from the build, this reduces the executable size, and requires that all code executed by the virtual machine be compiled with Full AOT before execution. large_code: Disables support for large assemblies. logging: Disables support for debug logging. pinvoke: Support for Platform Invocation services, disabling this will drop support for any libraries using DllImport. portability: Removes support for MONO_IOMAP, the environment variables for simplifying porting applications that are case-insensitive and that mix the Unix and Windows path separators. profiler: Disables support for the default profiler. reflection_emit: Drop System.Reflection.Emit support reflection_emit_save: Drop support for saving dynamically created assemblies (AssemblyBuilderAccess.Save) in System.Reflection.Emit. shadow_copy: Disables support for AppDomain's shadow copies (you can disable this if you do not plan on using appdomains). simd: Disables support for the Mono.SIMD intrinsics library. ssa: Disables compilation for the SSA optimization framework, and the various SSA-based optimizations. --enable-llvm This enables the use of LLVM as a code generation engine for Mono.  The LLVM code generator and optimizer will be used instead of Mono's built-in code generator for both Just in Time and Ahead of Time compilations. See  @link for the full details and up-to-date information on this feature. You will need to have an LLVM built that Mono can link against. --enable-big-arrays - Enable use of arrays with indexes larger than Int32.MaxValue. By default Mono has the same limitation as .NET on Win32 and Win64 and limits array indexes to 32-bit values (even on 64-bit systems). In certain scenarios where large arrays are required, you can pass this flag and Mono will be built to support 64-bit arrays. This is not the default as it breaks the C embedding ABI that we have exposed through the Mono development cycle. --enable-parallel-mark Use this option to enable the garbage collector to use multiple CPUs to do its work.  This helps performance on multi-CPU machines as the work is divided across CPUS. This option is not currently the default on OSX as it runs into issues there. This option only applies to the Boehm GC. --enable-dtrace On Solaris and MacOS X builds a version of the Mono runtime that contains DTrace probes and can participate in the system profiling using DTrace. --disable-dev-random Mono uses /dev/random to obtain good random data for any source that requires random numbers.   If your system does not support this, you might want to disable it. There are a number of runtime options to control this also, see the man page. --with-cscroslyn,mcs,default Use this option to configure which C compiler to use.  By default. the configure script will pick Roslyn, except on platforms where Roslyn does not work (Big Endian systems) where it will pick mcs. If you specify 'mcs', then Mono's C compiler will be used.  This. also allows for a complete bootstrap of Mono's core compiler and core libraries from source. If you specify 'roslyn', then Roslyn's C compiler will be used.. This currently uses Roslyn binaries. --enable-nacl This configures the Mono compiler to generate code suitable to be used by Google's Native Client: @link Currently this is used with Mono's AOT engine as Native Client does not support JIT engines yet. --enable-wasm Use this option to configure mono to run on WebAssembly. It will set both host and target to the WebAssembly triplet. This overrides the values passed to --host or --target and ignored what config.sub guesses. This is a workaround to enable usage of old automake versions that don't recognize the wasm triplet. Working With Submodules Mono references several external git submodules, for example a fork of Microsoft's reference source code that has been altered to be suitable for use with the Mono runtime. This section describes how to use it. An initial clone should be done recursively so all submodules will also be cloned in a single pass: $ git clone --recursive git@github.com:mono/mono Once cloned, submodules can be updated to pull down the latest changes. This can also be done after an initial non-recursive clone: $ git submodule update --init --recursive To pull external changes into a submodule: $ cd $ git pull origin $ cd $ git add $ git commit By default, submodules are detached because they point to a specific commit. Use git checkout to move back to a branch before making changes: $ cd $ git checkout"

This behavior can be overridden (app-wide) via a property located in 'Options-Properties-Tree build behaviour'.

1885,13404515,4,Java,You're probably doing it wrong.. AKA 'What you probably didn't know about connection pool sizing' @link .  Read on to find out. ------------------------------
1886,13404515,4,Java,"Configuration (knobs, baby!). HikariCP comes with sane defaults that perform well in most deployments without additional tweaking. Every property is optional, except for the 'essentials' marked below. &128206;&nbsp;HikariCP uses milliseconds for all time values.."
1887,13404515,5,Java,"Essentials. &128288;dataSourceClassName. This is the name of the DataSource class provided by the JDBC driver.  Consult the documentation for your specific JDBC driver to get this class name, or see the table @link  below.. Note XA data sources are not supported.  XA requires a real transaction manager like bitronix @link . Note that you do not need this property if you are using jdbcUrl for 'old-school' DriverManager-based JDBC driver configuration. Default: none - or - &128288;jdbcUrl. This property directs HikariCP to use 'DriverManager-based' configuration.  We feel that DataSource-based configuration (above) is superior for a variety of reasons (see below), but for many deployments there is little significant difference.  When using this property with 'old' drivers, you may also need to set the  driverClassName property, but try it first without.  Note that if this property is used, you may still use DataSource properties to configure your driver and is in fact recommended over driver parameters specified in the URL itself. Default: none &128288;username. This property sets the default authentication username used when obtaining Connections from the underlying driver.  Note that for DataSources this works in a very deterministic fashion by calling DataSource.getConnection(username, password) on the underlying DataSource.  However, for Driver-based configurations, every driver is different.  In the case of Driver-based, HikariCP will use this username property to set a user property in the Properties passed to the driver's DriverManager.getConnection(jdbcUrl, props) call.  If this is not what you need, skip this method entirely and call addDataSourceProperty('username', ...), for example. Default: none &128288;password. This property sets the default authentication password used when obtaining Connections from the underlying driver. Note that for DataSources this works in a very deterministic fashion by calling DataSource.getConnection(username, password) on the underlying DataSource.  However, for Driver-based configurations, every driver is different.  In the case of Driver-based, HikariCP will use this password property to set a password property in the Properties passed to the driver's DriverManager.getConnection(jdbcUrl, props) call.  If this is not what you need, skip this method entirely and call addDataSourceProperty('pass', ...), for example. Default: none"
1888,13404515,5,Java,"Frequently used. &9989;autoCommit. This property controls the default auto-commit behavior of connections returned from the pool. It is a boolean value. Default: true &8986;connectionTimeout. This property controls the maximum number of milliseconds that a client (that's you) will wait for a connection from the pool.  If this time is exceeded without a connection becoming available, a SQLException will be thrown.  1000ms is the minimum value. Default: 30000 (30 seconds) &8986;idleTimeout. This property controls the maximum amount of time that a connection is allowed to sit idle in the pool.  Whether a connection is retired as idle or not is subject to a maximum variation of 30 seconds, and average variation of 15 seconds.  A connection will never be retired as idle before this timeout.  A value of 0 means that idle connections are never removed from the pool. Default: 600000 (10 minutes) &8986;maxLifetime. This property controls the maximum lifetime of a connection in the pool.  When a connection reaches this timeout it will be retired from the pool, subject to a maximum variation of 30 seconds.  An in-use connection will never be retired, only when it is closed will it then be removed.  We strongly recommend setting this value, and it should be at least 30 seconds less than any database-level connection timeout.  A value of 0 indicates no maximum lifetime (infinite lifetime), subject of course to the idleTimeout setting. Default: 1800000 (30 minutes) &128288;connectionTestQuery. If your driver supports JDBC4 we strongly recommend not setting this property. This is for 'legacy' databases that do not support the JDBC4 Connection.isValid() API.  This is the query that will be executed just before a connection is given to you from the pool to validate that the connection to the database is still alive. Again, try running the pool without this property, HikariCP will log an error if your driver is not JDBC4 compliant to let you know. Default: none &128290;minimumIdle. This property controls the minimum number of idle connections that HikariCP tries to maintain in the pool.  If the idle connections dip below this value, HikariCP will make a best effort to add additional connections quickly and efficiently.  However, for maximum performance and responsiveness to spike demands, we recommend not setting this value and instead allowing HikariCP to act as a fixed size connection pool. Default: same as maximumPoolSize &128290;maximumPoolSize. This property controls the maximum size that the pool is allowed to reach, including both idle and in-use connections.  Basically this value will determine the maximum number of actual connections to the database backend.  A reasonable value for this is best determined by your execution environment.  When the pool reaches this size, and no idle connections are available, calls to getConnection() will block for up to connectionTimeout milliseconds before timing out. Default: 10 &128200;metricRegistry. This property is only available via programmatic configuration or IoC container.  This property allows you to specify an instance of a Codahale/Dropwizard MetricRegistry to be used by the pool to record various metrics.  See the Metrics @link wiki page for details. Default: none &128200;healthCheckRegistry. This property is only available via programmatic configuration or IoC container.  This property allows you to specify an instance of a Codahale/Dropwizard HealthCheckRegistry to be used by the pool to report current health information.  See the Health Checks @link wiki page for details. Default: none &128288;poolName. This property represents a user-defined name for the connection pool and appears mainly in logging and JMX management consoles to identify pools and pool configurations. Default: auto-generated"
1889,13404515,5,Java,"Infrequently used. &9989;initializationFailFast. This property controls whether the pool will 'fail fast' if the pool cannot be seeded with initial connections successfully.  If you want your application to start even when the database is down/unavailable, set this property to false. Default: true &10062;isolateInternalQueries. This property determines whether HikariCP isolates internal pool queries, such as the connection alive test, in their own transaction.  Since these are typically read-only queries, it is rarely necessary to encapsulate them in their own transaction.  This property only applies if autoCommit is disabled. Default: false &10062;allowPoolSuspension. This property controls whether the pool can be suspended and resumed through JMX.  This is useful for certain failover automation scenarios.  When the pool is suspended, calls to getConnection() will not timeout and will be held until the pool is resumed. Default: false &10062;readOnly. This property controls whether Connections obtained from the pool are in read-only mode by default.  Note some databases do not support the concept of read-only mode, while others provide query optimizations when the Connection is set to read-only.  Whether you need this property or not will depend largely on your application and database. Default: false &10062;registerMbeans. This property controls whether or not JMX Management Beans ('MBeans') are registered or not. Default: false &128288;catalog. This property sets the default catalog for databases that support the concept of catalogs. If this property is not specified, the default catalog defined by the JDBC driver is used. Default: driver default &128288;connectionInitSql. This property sets a SQL statement that will be executed after every new connection creation before adding it to the pool. If this SQL is not valid or throws an exception, it will be treated as a connection failure and the standard retry logic will be followed. Default: none &128288;driverClassName. HikariCP will attempt to resolve a driver through the DriverManager based solely on the jdbcUrl, but for some older drivers the driverClassName must also be specified.  Omit this property unless you get an obvious error message indicating that the driver was not found. Default: none &128288;transactionIsolation. This property controls the default transaction isolation level of connections returned from the pool.  If this property is not specified, the default transaction isolation level defined by the JDBC driver is used.  Only use this property if you have specific isolation requirements that are common for all queries.  The value of this property is the constant name from the Connection class such as TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED, TRANSACTION_REPEATABLE_READ, etc. Default: driver default &8986;validationTimeout. This property controls the maximum amount of time that a connection will be tested for aliveness. This value must be less than the connectionTimeout.  The lowest accepted validation timeout is 1000ms (1 second). Default: 5000 &8986;leakDetectionThreshold. This property controls the amount of time that a connection can be out of the pool before a message is logged indicating a possible connection leak.  A value of 0 means leak detection is disabled.  Lowest acceptable value for enabling leak detection is 2000 (2 secs). Default: 0 &10145;dataSource. This property is only available via programmatic configuration or IoC container.  This property allows you to directly set the instance of the DataSource to be wrapped by the pool, rather than having HikariCP construct it via reflection.  This can be useful in some dependency injection frameworks. When this property is specified, the dataSourceClassName property and all DataSource-specific properties will be ignored. Default: none &10145;threadFactory. This property is only available via programmatic configuration or IoC container.  This property allows you to set the instance of the java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory that will be used for creating all threads used by the pool. It is needed in some restricted execution environments where threads can only be created through a ThreadFactory provided by the application container. Default: none"
1890,13404515,4,Java,"Missing Knobs. HikariCP has plenty of 'knobs' to turn as you can see above, but comparatively less than some other pools. This is a design philosophy.  The HikariCP design aesthetic is Minimalism.  In keeping with the simple is better or less is more design philosophy, some configuration axis are intentionally left out."
1891,13404515,4,Java,"Statement Cache. Many connection pools, including Apache DBCP, Vibur, CP30 and others offer PreparedStatement caching. HikariCP does not.  Why? At the connection pool layer PreparedStatements can only be cached per connection.  If your application has 250 commonly executed queries and a pool of 20 connections you are asking your database to hold on to 5000 query execution plans -- and similarly the pool must cache this many PreparedStatements and their related graph of objects. Most major database JDBC drivers already have a Statement cache that can be configured, including PostgreSQL, Oracle, Derby, MySQL, DB2, and many others.  JDBC drivers are in a unique position to exploit database specific features, and nearly all of the caching implementations are capable of sharing execution plans across connections. This means that instead of 5000 statements in memory and associated execution plans, your 250 commonly executed queries result in exactly 250 execution plans in the database.  Clever implementations do not even retain PreparedStatement objects in memory at the driver-level but instead merely attach new instances to existing plan IDs. Using a statement cache at the pooling layer is an anti-pattern @link , and will negatively impact your application performance compared to driver-provided caches."
1892,13404515,4,Java,"Log Statement Text / Slow Query Logging. Like Statement caching, most major database vendors support statement logging through properties of their own driver.  This includes Oracle, MySQL, Derby, MSSQL, and others.  Some even support slow query logging.  For those few databases that do not support it, log4jdbc @link  or jdbcdslog-exp @link  are good options. ----------------------------------------------------"
1893,13404515,3,Java,"Initialization. You can use the HikariConfig class like so: @Code or directly instantiate a HikariDataSource like so: @Code or property file based: @Code Example property file: @Code or java.util.Properties based: @Code There is also a System property available, hikaricp.configurationFile, that can be used to specify the location of a properties file.  If you intend to use this option, construct a HikariConfig or HikariDataSource instance using the default constructor and the properties file will be loaded."
1894,13404515,3,Java,"Popular DataSource Class Names. We recommended using dataSourceClassName instead of jdbcUrl, but both are acceptable.  We'll say that again, both are acceptable.  Note: Spring Boot auto-configuration users, you need to use jdbcUrl-based configuration. Here is a list of JDBC DataSource classes for popular databases:"

1924,163387337,2,Java,What is Seata?. A distributed transaction solution with high performance and ease of use for microservices architecture.
1925,163387337,3,Java,"Distributed Transaction Problem in Microservices. Let's imagine a traditional monolithic application. Its business is built up with 3 modules. They use a single local data source. Naturally, data consistency will be guaranteed by the local transaction. Things have changed in a microservices architecture. The 3 modules mentioned above are designed to be 3 services on top of 3 different data sources (Pattern: Database per service @link ). Data consistency within every single service is naturally guaranteed by the local transaction. But how about the whole business logic scope?"
1926,163387337,3,Java,"How Seata do?. Seata is just a solution to the problem mentioned above. Firstly, how to define a Distributed Transaction? We say, a Distributed Transaction is a Global Transaction which is made up with a batch of Branch Transaction, and normally Branch Transaction is just Local Transaction. There are three roles in Seata Framework: - Transaction Coordinator(TC): Maintain status of global and branch transactions, drive the global commit or rollback. - Transaction Manager(TM): Define the scope of global transaction: begin a global transaction, commit or rollback a global transaction. - Resource Manager(RM): Manage resources that branch transactions working on, talk to TC for registering branch transactions and reporting status of branch transactions, and drive the branch transaction commit or rollback. A typical lifecycle of Seata managed distributed transaction: 1. TM asks TC to begin a new global transaction. TC generates an XID representing the global transaction. 2. XID is propagated through microservices' invoke chain. 3. RM registers local transaction as a branch of the corresponding global transaction of XID to TC. 4. TM asks TC for committing or rollbacking the corresponding global transaction of XID. 5. TC drives all branch transactions under the corresponding global transaction of XID to finish branch committing or rollbacking. For more details about principle and design, please go to Seata wiki page @link ."

1956,17804584,2,Java,"Default Methods for Interfaces. Java 8 enables us to add non-abstract method implementations to interfaces by utilizing the default keyword. This feature is also known as virtual extension methods @link . Here is our first example: @Code Besides the abstract method calculate the interface Formula also defines the default method sqrt. Concrete classes only have to implement the abstract method calculate. The default method sqrt can be used out of the box. @Code The formula is implemented as an anonymous object. The code is quite verbose: 6 lines of code for such a simple calculation of sqrt(a  100). As we'll see in the next section, there's a much nicer way of implementing single method objects in Java 8."
1957,17804584,2,Java,"Lambda expressions. Let's start with a simple example of how to sort a list of strings in prior versions of Java: @Code The static utility method Collections.sort accepts a list and a comparator in order to sort the elements of the given list. You often find yourself creating anonymous comparators and pass them to the sort method. Instead of creating anonymous objects all day long, Java 8 comes with a much shorter syntax, lambda expressions: @Code As you can see the code is much shorter and easier to read. But it gets even shorter: @Code For one line method bodies you can skip both the braces {} and the return keyword. But it gets even shorter: @Code List now has a sort method. Also the java compiler is aware of the parameter types so you can skip them as well. Let's dive deeper into how lambda expressions can be used in the wild."
1958,17804584,2,Java,"Functional Interfaces. How does lambda expressions fit into Java's type system? Each lambda corresponds to a given type, specified by an interface. A so called _functional interface_ must contain exactly one abstract method declaration. Each lambda expression of that type will be matched to this abstract method. Since default methods are not abstract you're free to add default methods to your functional interface. We can use arbitrary interfaces as lambda expressions as long as the interface only contains one abstract method. To ensure that your interface meet the requirements, you should add the @FunctionalInterface annotation. The compiler is aware of this annotation and throws a compiler error as soon as you try to add a second abstract method declaration to the interface. Example: @Code @Code Keep in mind that the code is also valid if the @FunctionalInterface annotation would be omitted."
1959,17804584,2,Java,"Method and Constructor References. The above example code can be further simplified by utilizing static method references: @Code Java 8 enables you to pass references of methods or constructors via the :: keyword. The above example shows how to reference a static method. But we can also reference object methods: @Code @Code Let's see how the :: keyword works for constructors. First we define an example class with different constructors: @Code Next we specify a person factory interface to be used for creating new persons: @Code Instead of implementing the factory manually, we glue everything together via constructor references: @Code We create a reference to the Person constructor via Person::new. The Java compiler automatically chooses the right constructor by matching the signature of PersonFactory.create."
1960,17804584,2,Java,Lambda Scopes. Accessing outer scope variables from lambda expressions is very similar to anonymous objects. You can access final variables from the local outer scope as well as instance fields and static variables.
1961,17804584,3,Java,Accessing local variables. We can read final local variables from the outer scope of lambda expressions: @Code But different to anonymous objects the variable num does not have to be declared final. This code is also valid: @Code However num must be implicitly final for the code to compile. The following code does not compile: @Code Writing to num from within the lambda expression is also prohibited.
1962,17804584,3,Java,"Accessing fields and static variables. In contrast to local variables, we have both read and write access to instance fields and static variables from within lambda expressions. This behaviour is well known from anonymous objects. @Code"
1963,17804584,3,Java,Accessing Default Interface Methods. Remember the formula example from the first section? Interface Formula defines a default method sqrt which can be accessed from each formula instance including anonymous objects. This does not work with lambda expressions. Default methods cannot be accessed from within lambda expressions. The following code does not compile: @Code
1964,17804584,2,Java,Built-in Functional Interfaces. The JDK 1.8 API contains many built-in functional interfaces. Some of them are well known from older versions of Java like Comparator or Runnable. Those existing interfaces are extended to enable Lambda support via the @FunctionalInterface annotation. But the Java 8 API is also full of new functional interfaces to make your life easier. Some of those new interfaces are well known from the Google Guava @link  library. Even if you're familiar with this library you should keep a close eye on how those interfaces are extended by some useful method extensions.
1965,17804584,3,Java,"Predicates. Predicates are boolean-valued functions of one argument. The interface contains various default methods for composing predicates to complex logical terms (and, or, negate) @Code"
1966,17804584,3,Java,"Functions. Functions accept one argument and produce a result. Default methods can be used to chain multiple functions together (compose, andThen). @Code"
1967,17804584,3,Java,"Suppliers. Suppliers produce a result of a given generic type. Unlike Functions, Suppliers don't accept arguments. @Code"
1968,17804584,3,Java,Consumers. Consumers represent operations to be performed on a single input argument. @Code
1969,17804584,3,Java,Comparators. Comparators are well known from older versions of Java. Java 8 adds various default methods to the interface. @Code
1970,17804584,2,Java,"Streams. A java.util.Stream represents a sequence of elements on which one or more operations can be performed. Stream operations are either _intermediate_ or _terminal_. While terminal operations return a result of a certain type, intermediate operations return the stream itself so you can chain multiple method calls in a row. Streams are created on a source, e.g. a java.util.Collection like lists or sets (maps are not supported). Stream operations can either be executed sequentially or parallely. Streams are extremely powerful, so I wrote a separate Java 8 Streams Tutorial @link . You should also check out Sequency @link  as a similiar library for the web. Let's first look how sequential streams work. First we create a sample source in form of a list of strings: @Code"
1971,17804584,3,Java,Sorted. Sorted is an _intermediate_ operation which returns a sorted view of the stream. The elements are sorted in natural order unless you pass a custom Comparator. @Code Keep in mind that sorted does only create a sorted view of the stream without manipulating the ordering of the backed collection. The ordering of stringCollection is untouched: @Code
1972,17804584,3,Java,Map. The _intermediate_ operation map converts each element into another object via the given function. The following example converts each string into an upper-cased string. But you can also use map to transform each object into another type. The generic type of the resulting stream depends on the generic type of the function you pass to map. @Code
1973,17804584,3,Java,Match. Various matching operations can be used to check whether a certain predicate matches the stream. All of those operations are _terminal_ and return a boolean result. @Code
1974,17804584,4,Java,Count. Count is a _terminal_ operation returning the number of elements in the stream as a long. @Code
1975,17804584,3,Java,Reduce. This _terminal_ operation performs a reduction on the elements of the stream with the given function. The result is an Optional holding the reduced value. @Code
1976,17804584,2,Java,"Parallel Streams. As mentioned above streams can be either sequential or parallel. Operations on sequential streams are performed on a single thread while operations on parallel streams are performed concurrently on multiple threads. The following example demonstrates how easy it is to increase the performance by using parallel streams. First we create a large list of unique elements: @Code The above code should be self-explaining: putIfAbsent prevents us from writing additional if null checks; forEach accepts a consumer to perform operations for each value of the map. This example shows how to compute code on the map by utilizing functions: @Code Next, we learn how to remove entries for a given key, only if it's currently mapped to a given value: @Code Another helpful method: @Code Merging entries of a map is quite easy: @Code Merge either put the key/value into the map if no entry for the key exists, or the merging function will be called to change the existing value."
1977,17804584,2,Java,"Date API. Java 8 contains a brand new date and time API under the package java.time. The new Date API is comparable with the Joda-Time @link  library, however it's not the same @link . The following examples cover the most important parts of this new API."
1978,17804584,3,Java,Clock. Clock provides access to the current date and time. Clocks are aware of a timezone and may be used instead of System.currentTimeMillis() to retrieve the current time in milliseconds since Unix EPOCH. Such an instantaneous point on the time-line is also represented by the class Instant. Instants can be used to create legacy java.util.Date objects. @Code
1979,17804584,3,Java,Timezones. Timezones are represented by a ZoneId. They can easily be accessed via static factory methods. Timezones define the offsets which are important to convert between instants and local dates and times. @Code
1980,17804584,3,Java,"LocalTime. LocalTime represents a time without a timezone, e.g. 10pm or 17:30:15. The following example creates two local times for the timezones defined above. Then we compare both times and calculate the difference in hours and minutes between both times. @Code LocalTime comes with various factory methods to simplify the creation of new instances, including parsing of time strings. @Code"
1981,17804584,3,Java,"LocalDate. LocalDate represents a distinct date, e.g. 2014-03-11. It's immutable and works exactly analog to LocalTime. The sample demonstrates how to calculate new dates by adding or subtracting days, months or years. Keep in mind that each manipulation returns a new instance. @Code Parsing a LocalDate from a string is just as simple as parsing a LocalTime: @Code"
1982,17804584,3,Java,LocalDateTime. LocalDateTime represents a date-time. It combines date and time as seen in the above sections into one instance. LocalDateTime is immutable and works similar to LocalTime and LocalDate. We can utilize methods for retrieving certain fields from a date-time: @Code With the additional information of a timezone it can be converted to an instant. Instants can easily be converted to legacy dates of type java.util.Date. @Code Formatting date-times works just like formatting dates or times. Instead of using pre-defined formats we can create formatters from custom patterns. @Code Unlike java.text.NumberFormat the new DateTimeFormatter is immutable and thread-safe. For details on the pattern syntax read here @link .
1983,17804584,2,Java,"Annotations. Annotations in Java 8 are repeatable. Let's dive directly into an example to figure that out. First, we define a wrapper annotation which holds an array of the actual annotations: @Code Java 8 enables us to use multiple annotations of the same type by declaring the annotation @Repeatable."
1984,17804584,3,Java,Variant 1: Using the container annotation (old school). @Code
1985,17804584,3,Java,"Variant 2: Using repeatable annotations (new school). @Code Using variant 2 the java compiler implicitly sets up the @Hints annotation under the hood. That's important for reading annotation information via reflection. @Code Although we never declared the @Hints annotation on the Person class, it's still readable via getAnnotation(Hints.class). However, the more convenient method is getAnnotationsByType which grants direct access to all annotated @Hint annotations. Furthermore the usage of annotations in Java 8 is expanded to two new targets: @Code"

1994,20300177,2,Java,"IMPORTANT WARNINGS. 1.  APIs marked with the @Beta annotation at the class or method level are subject to change. They can be modified in any way, or even removed, at any time. If your code is a library itself (i.e., it is used on the CLASSPATH of users outside your own control), you should not use beta APIs unless you repackage them. If your code is a library, we strongly recommend using the Guava Beta Checker to ensure that you do not use any @Beta APIs! 2.  APIs without @Beta will remain binary-compatible for the indefinite future. (Previously, we sometimes removed such APIs after a deprecation period. The last release to remove non-@Beta APIs was Guava 21.0.) Even @Deprecated APIs will remain (again, unless they are @Beta). We have no plans to start removing things again, but officially, we're leaving our options open in case of surprises (like, say, a serious security problem). 3.  Guava has one dependency that is needed for linkage at runtime: com.google.guava:failureaccess:1.0.2. It also has some annotation-only dependenciesguava-deps, which we discuss in more detail at that link. 4.  Serialized forms of ALL objects are subject to change unless noted otherwise. Do not persist these and assume they can be read by a future version of the library. 5.  Our classes are not designed to protect against a malicious caller. You should not use them for communication between trusted and untrusted code. 6.  For the mainline flavor, we test the libraries using OpenJDK 8, 11, and 17 on Linux, with some additional testing on newer JDKs and on Windows.

2047,2211243,3,Java,"Common build options . The following options should be set with a -P switch, for example ./gradlew -PmaxParallelForks1 test. commitId: sets the build commit ID as .git/HEAD might not be correct if there are local commits added for build purposes. mavenUrl: sets the URL of the maven deployment repository (file://path/to/repo can be used to point to a local repository). maxParallelForks: maximum number of test processes to start in parallel. Defaults to the number of processors available to the JVM. maxScalacThreads: maximum number of worker threads for the scalac backend. Defaults to the lowest of 8 and the number of processors available to the JVM. The value must be between 1 and 16 (inclusive). ignoreFailures: ignore test failures from junit showStandardStreams: shows standard out and standard error of the test JVM(s) on the console. skipSigning: skips signing of artifacts. testLoggingEvents: unit test events to be logged, separated by comma. For example ./gradlew -PtestLoggingEventsstarted,passed,skipped,failed test. xmlSpotBugsReport: enable XML reports for spotBugs. This also disables HTML reports as only one can be enabled at a time. maxTestRetries: maximum number of retries for a failing test case. maxTestRetryFailures: maximum number of test failures before retrying is disabled for subsequent tests. enableTestCoverage: enables test coverage plugins and tasks, including bytecode enhancement of classes required to track said coverage. Note that this introduces some overhead when running tests and hence why it's disabled by default (the overhead varies, but 15-20% is a reasonable estimate). keepAliveMode: configures the keep alive mode for the Gradle compilation daemon - reuse improves start-up time. The values should be one of daemon or session (the default is daemon). daemon keeps the daemon alive until it's explicitly stopped while session keeps it alive until the end of the build session. This currently only affects the Scala compiler, see @link for a PR that attempts to do the same for the Java compiler. scalaOptimizerMode: configures the optimizing behavior of the scala compiler, the value should be one of none, method, inline-kafka or inline-scala (the default is inline-kafka). none is the scala compiler default, which only eliminates unreachable code. method also includes method-local optimizations. inline-kafka adds inlining of methods within the kafka packages. Finally, inline-scala also includes inlining of methods within the scala library (which avoids lambda allocations for methods like Option.exists). inline-scala is only safe if the Scala library version is the same at compile time and runtime. Since we cannot guarantee this for all cases (for example, users may depend on the kafka jar for integration tests where they may include a scala library with a different version), we don't enable it by default. See  @link for more details."

It has been successfully tested on TVs, TV boxes and TV sticks that are based on Android, including: - Android TVs & Google TVs (e.g. Philips, Sony) - Chromecast with Google TV & TVs with _Chromecast built-in_ - Amazon FireTV stick (all generations) - NVIDIA Shield - TV boxes running Android (many cheap chinese no-name boxes) - Xiaomi Mi Box"
2081,283211901,3,Java,"Adblocking . SmartTube does not show any ad banners, preroll ads or ad intermissions. It not just tries to prevent them, it is literally programmed to be completely unable to display any ads, so YouTube cannot slip anything in. This also means you cannot allow ads or whitelist channels. Some YouTube channels include sponsored messages in their videos, these can also be skipped, see SponsorBlock(SponsorBlock) below. ."
2082,283211901,3,Java,"SponsorBlock . SmartTube includes a SponsorBlock integration. From the SponsorBlock website @link : SponsorBlock is an open-source crowdsourced browser extension and open API for skipping sponsor segments in YouTube videos. ... the extension automatically skips sponsors it knows about using a privacy preserving query system. It also supports skipping other categories, such as intros, outros and reminders to subscribe and non-music parts in music videos. You can select which categories you want to skip in the settings. Unlike the browser addon, in SmartTube you cannot submit new segments (TVs and TV remotes aren't great devices for such precise operations). Note that SponsorBlock is a free and voluntary project based on user submissions, so don't expect it to 100% work every time. Sometimes, sponsor segments are not yet submitted to the database, sometimes the SponsorBlock servers are offline/overloaded."
2083,283211901,3,Java,"Casting . To cast videos from your phone (or other devices), you must link that device to your TV. Unlike the original YouTube app, SmartTube does not automatically show up when you are in the same wifi network. How to link your smartphone and TV: 1. open SmartTube and go to settings 2. go to 'Remote control' (2nd option) 3. open your YouTube app on your phone, go to settings  General  watch on TV 4. click on _connect using TV-code_ and enter the code from your TV Screenshot guide @link Due to technical limitations, you need to open the app on the TV before casting; SmartTube cannot automatically wake up the TV."
2084,283211901,3,Java,"Picture-in-Picture (PiP) . SmartTube supports playing videos in PiP mode. This needs to be enabled under _Settings  General  Background playback  Picture in picture_. The video will go into PiP mode when you press home while playing a video, and also when you press _back_ if enabled in _Settings  General  Background playback (activation)_."
2085,283211901,3,Java,"Adjust Speed . You can adjust the playback speed pressing the speed-indicator icon (gauge) in the top row of the player. This is remembered across videos. Some speeds may case frame drops, this is a known issue."
2086,283211901,3,Java,"Voice Search . To enable global voice search, an additional app must be installed alongside SmartTube. This _bridge app_ can intercept the System's attempts to open the original YouTube app and open SmartTube instead. For this to work, you must uninstall the original YouTube app. We know this sucks, but you can always reinstall it if you change your mind. The _bridge app_ will not show up in your launcher and you cannot launch it directly; it is only used internally by the system's voice search. On some devices, you need to explicitly say 'Youtube' when searching (e.g. say 'youtube cute cats' instead of just 'cute cats'). On Amazon Fire TV: 1. uninstall the original YouTube app (no root required) 2. download and install the Amazon Bridge SmartTube app:  @link (e.g. via _Downloader by AFTVnews_) On Google Chromecast with Google TV: 1. uninstall the original YouTube app (no root required) 3. download and install the ATV Bridge SmartTube app:  @link (e.g. via _Downloader by AFTVnews_) On all other Android devices, sadly root is required to enable this: 1. root your device (search for a guide for your specific device) 2. uninstall the official YouTube app using root (adb shell pm uninstall com.google.android.youtube.tv) 3. download and install the ATV Bridge SmartTube app:  @link (e.g. via _Downloader by AFTVnews_)"

2091,283211901,2,Java,Video codecs . Video codecs are the algorithms used for video compression.
2092,283211901,3,Java,"Which codec to choose / overview . \ Examples taken from the video-only track at 1080p @ 25fps for this video: Dua Lipa - New Rules (Official Music Video) @link At the same resolution, a lower bitrate is better! YouTube explicitly targets the same quality regardless of the codec. Older codecs have a higher bitrate only because they are less efficient. On Youtube, you do not get better quality by simply choosing a higher bitrate. Newer codecs have a better compression  lower bitrate  use less bandwidth  save the environment. This is a feature, not a bug. You should use the newest codec that works smoothly on your device, not the least efficient one. AVC usually has the highest bitrate. This is bad, not good."
2093,283211901,3,Java,"Which quality to choose? . Currently, there is no automatic mode based on your bandwidth. But you can configure a default video preset yourself under settings \ video player \ video presets. The first option ('none') will remember your last selection within the video player. Any other preset is used initially for each video; if the selected profile is not available, the next best available option is used. You can still override the profile on each video individually within the player. To decide the optional resolution / video quality for you, you need to consider a few limiting factors: - your bandwidth (choose only up to the bitrate that your bandwidth can handle; you can do a speedtest using fast.com @link  by Netflix) - your TV's display resolution (the quality might slightly improve, if you select the next higher resolution, e.g. 1080p on a 720p display; but don't expect a big difference) - your TV's capabilities (e.g. HDR, 60fps) Generally 60fps is an improvement, but if you personally don't notice (or mind) the difference, you can save bandwidth (and the environment) by not choosing 60fps."
2094,283211901,3,Java,"HDR . HDR works only if your hardware supports it. It's a complicated mess. - Your TV must support it - If you use a TV box, that TV box and your TV cable and the TV must support HDR - Yes, there truly are different HDMI cable versions with different HDR-support, it's complicated - some devices (like the NVIDIA Shield) generally support HDR, but not the specific HDR format that is used on YouTube :cry: If HDR videos look looked dim or washed out, then check this article @link . If HDR is not working, it's probably not this app's fault. You might need to search on the web for 'HDR' and your device name for any help."

2096,283211901,3,Java,Q: Videos buffer a LOT . A: Try to switch to encrypted DNS like NextDNS. You can set-up such DNS either automatically or manually. To automatic set-up you can use the Intra apk at fdroid @link  and the 'AutoStart - No root' @link  apk to make it autolaunch after every TV restart. For manual set-up use this guide @link .
2097,283211901,3,Java,Q: There is no result for the search that I say (Android 11) . A: They're some reports that the latest update for 'Google app for Android TV' could cause this bug. Deleting the update should fix the problem.
2098,283211901,3,Java,"Q: AV01 does not play / Why is VP9 slow on my device? . A: Because AV01 is very new, most TVs and TV boxes not not offer hardware support and cannot play AV01 at all. If your device has hardware support for a codec, videos using that codec should play smoothly. High resolutions might also be slow in VP9 on cheap TV boxes that don't officially support 4k. Your device probably can play VP9 videos even without hardware support, however this requires a powerful CPU to run smoothly. Fixing AV01 without hardware support is technically possible, but currently not planned and probably not efficient enough."
2099,283211901,3,Java,"Q: Can you make SmartTube look like the original app? . A: Compared to SmartTube's UI, Stock Youtube and YT Kids are far ahead. However, we'd need someone who's skilled and willing to dedicate enough time and energy into making it. And into maintaining it longterm (incl. new features, bug fixes). All of this for free. If you are / got someone like that, please help. Not to mention that SmartTube follows Google's official template & recommendations for Android TV apps. It's Google's fault that the template is somewhat ugly."
2100,283211901,3,Java,"Q: Can the search page be improved? . A: It can be, but it takes someone to do it, similar to the above FAQ-entry. SmartTube is following Google's officially recommended design/template for TV apps and is using the official, preinstalled Android TV keyboard. Sadly, Google did a really bad job regarding the search page and keyboard. Maybe a future SmartTube update can add an embedded keyboard, similar to the original YouTube or other major Android TV apps. Maybe it can improve the looks to be as good or better than in the official YouTube app. But for now, it is the way it is due to lack of time and due to Google's official recommendations being bad."
2101,283211901,3,Java,"Q: Can I install this on a Samsung Tizen TV / LG webOS TV / Roku / iOS / toaster? . A: No, this only works on Android devices. If you look at an Android TV's product page, it usually says clearly that it's based on Android. The app cannot easily be ported over to other plattforms and we have no plans to even try. Please do not ask. Instead, you can connect a separate TV stick or TV box to your TV."
2102,283211901,3,Java,"Q: Can I install this on a smartphone? / Can you add portrait mode? / Scrolling doesn't work. . A: Big No. This app is not for smartphones, we offer zero support for that. You can cast videos from your smartphone to a TV / TV box running SmartTube, though. Just use the official YouTube app or ReVanced @link , see the casting section(casting) for more information. . There will not be a phone version. You can use ReVanced @link , Pure Tuber @link , NewPipe @link , or NewPipe x SponsorBlock @link  instead. Please go to their respective support chats for help. ."
2103,283211901,3,Java,"Q: Can I install this on a tablet / car screen / smartphone with docking station? . Yes... maybe.. Requirements: - it is an Android device - it has a large screen - it has a TV remote, controller, or keyboard Touch input and is not supported. Mouse/touchpad scrolling neither. You cannot properly use SmartTube with only touch or mouse input. Some users reported great success (incl. on a car entertainment system @link ). Please share your success stories with us."
2104,283211901,3,Java,"Q: I get 'unknown codec' / 'can't download video' errors . A: please wait 5 seconds for the video to play. If that doesn't help, press the play button. Some users reported, that this issue only appears when they have a USB audio device attached or if their disk storage is full."
2105,283211901,3,Java,"Q: I get 'the video profile is not supported' . A. Press the 'HQ'-button in the bottom-left, select _video formats_ and select anything other than AV01. AV01 is not supported on most devices (apparently including yours), so select VP9 instead. See the section on video codecs(Video-codecs) for more information. ."
2106,283211901,3,Java,"Q: I get 'video unavailable' when watching unlisted videos / my own videos . A: Right, that's currently a bug."
2107,283211901,3,Java,Q: It doesn't show up on my casting list . A: Please read the Casting(casting) section. .
2108,283211901,3,Java,"Q: The video is buffering a lot . A: The issue might not be specific to SmartTube, as other unofficial YouTube apps also report this issue. It seems uncommon nowadays, but was very present in the 2nd quarter of 2021. Some users or devices seem to be more affected then others. The official YouTube app & website are apparently only rarely affected. The root cause of the issue is currently unclear, but it appears to be a server-side thing on YouTube's end. Possibly, YouTube is discriminating 3rd party apps. For now, try to see if it helps to: - reduce the resolution (or chance it back) - change the video format to AVC - increase the buffer in the settings - hit the back button and try playing the video again"
2109,283211901,3,Java,"Q: The debug information says my display is 1080p, but I have a 4k/UHD display! . A: Do not worry, the debug information is incorrect. SmartTube works fine even above 1080p and you should be able to see that, when you play a video in 4k or UHD. Also do not worry if it says '720p' and you have a 1080p display."
2110,283211901,3,Java,"Q: Why does it not autoselect highest quality? . A: It does (by default). If you set a _video profile_ under settings, that acts as a maximum for automatic selection. Check if you configured a video profile, you can unset it by choosing 'none'. Please do not confuse quality with bitrate. See the section on video codecs(Video-codecs) for more information. ."
2111,283211901,3,Java,"Q: Can I set a (maximum) resolution by default? . A: SmartTube automatically select the highest available quality for your video, up to a maximum resolution that you can set in the settings under 'video profile'. If available, SmartTube will pick the selected video profile, or otherwise the next best one available will be used. You can still always change the video profile while watching videos."
2112,283211901,3,Java,"Q: Can it set the resolution to 'auto', depending on my available bandwidth? . A: This is planned, but not available yet (sorry ). However, you can set a maximum resolution to something that should work for your bandwidth. See above for details."
2113,283211901,3,Java,"Q: Why does it skip video segments? . A: SmartTube has a feature called SponsorBlock. You can select categories should be skipped, if any. See the SponsorBlock section(sponsorblock) for more details. ."
2114,283211901,3,Java,Q: How to start the next video automatically / stop after every video? . A: You can switch between different autoplay-modes using the loop-button @link
2115,283211901,3,Java,"Q: How to remove recommended videos (e.g. news) that are unrelated to me? . A: Recommended videos are defined by YouTube and not by the app, we cannot change the algorithm. They are based on your country, which you can change in the settings. If you are logged in, they are based on your watch history, user profile data, and whatever else Google might use. If you are not logged in, you are like in 'incognito mode', so your watch history does not influence your recommendations. Maybe a future version will add optional user profiling without logging in."
2116,283211901,3,Java,"Q: Does HDR work? . A: Yes, HDR works if your hardware supports it. The NVIDIA Shield does not. See the section on HDR(HDR) for more information. ."
2117,283211901,3,Java,"Q: Why do some updates say 'don't update if satisfied with the current version' in the changelog? . A: These updates change a lot of code, trying to fix bugs that only affect a few users/devices. Only the affected users should update. For anyone else, there is nothing to gain from updating; however there is the chance of causing new bugs. Do not worry if you updated anyways."
2118,283211901,3,Java,"Q: When playing at other speeds, frames are skipped! . A: We currently cannot fix this, sorry."
2119,283211901,3,Java,"Q: What is AFR? . A: 'Auto Frame Rate'. It adjusts the refresh rate of your TV to match the content you're watching. It can slightly improve the smoothness, but the difference is very small; most people barely notice it. It does not work well on every hardware. If you don't know what it does and don't want to test it out yourself, you can safely keep it off. Recommendation: You can turn it on to see if it works on your device; if it causes issues (or if you don't care to test), turn it off."
2120,283211901,3,Java,"Q: Should I choose high or low buffer? . A: The higher your buffer, the more of a video will be preloaded ahead of your current position. A low buffer might minimally reduce your bandwidth usage, if you often close videos before they end. A high buffer can smooth out network issues and prevent the video from pausing to buffer. A higher buffer increases RAM usage, however this shouldn't be an issue. Recommendation: high."
2121,283211901,3,Java,"Q: Can I retain the buffer when seeking back? . A: No, when you seek back (e.g. jump back 5 seconds), SmartTube will have to rebuffer. This might be improved in a future update."
2122,283211901,3,Java,"Q: My device freezes when watching YouTube . A: That's a firmware or Android issue. If you are using a custom rom, maybe that rom is buggy. Because this issue is nearly impossible for the developer to debug, we cannot help you, sorry. You can try the usual workarounds: rebooting, clearing cache, reinstalling the app, or factory resetting the device."
2123,283211901,3,Java,Q: Can I remove videos from the history? . A: not yet
2124,283211901,3,Java,Q: Can I download videos? . A: not with SmartTube
2125,283211901,3,Java,"Q: Can updates be installed automatically? . A: no, this is technically not possible. Only the preinstalled app manager (usually Google PlayStore, Amazon AppStore, etc) has the required permission. All other apps, incl. SmartTube can only show open installation prompt. A workaround using root would be possible, but hasn't been implemented yet."
2126,283211901,3,Java,"Q: Can I whitelist ads on some channels? . A: no, this is not possible. SmartTube does not have any code to display ads. Adding this functionality would actually take time and effort, which is instead spent on adding useful features and fixing bugs."

2151,32538871,1,Java,"Gson. Gson is a Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation. It can also be used to convert a JSON string to an equivalent Java object. Gson can work with arbitrary Java objects including pre-existing objects that you do not have source-code of. There are a few open-source projects that can convert Java objects to JSON. However, most of them require that you place Java annotations in your classes; something that you can not do if you do not have access to the source-code. Most also do not fully support the use of Java Generics. Gson considers both of these as very important design goals. \ Gson is currently in maintenance mode; existing bugs will be fixed, but large new features will likely not be added. If you want to add a new feature, please first search for existing GitHub issues, or create a new one to discuss the feature and get feedback. \ Gson's main focus is on Java. Using it with other JVM languages such as Kotlin or Scala might work fine in many cases, but language-specific features such as Kotlin's non-null types or constructors with default arguments are not supported. This can lead to confusing and incorrect behavior.\ When using languages other than Java, prefer a JSON library with explicit support for that language."

NOTICE: It is highly recommended that you update to v0.118.0 or higher ASAP for various bug fixes, including a critical world-readable vulnerability reported here @link . See below(google-play-store-experimental-branch) for information regarding Termux on Google Play.. Termux can be obtained through various sources listed below for only Android  7 with full support for apps and packages. Support for both app and packages was dropped for Android 5 and 6 on 2020-01-01 @link  at v0.83, however it was re-added just for the app without any support for package updates on 2022-05-24 @link  via the GitHub(github) sources. Check here @link  for the details.. The APK files of different sources are signed with different signature keys. The Termux app and all its plugins use the same sharedUserId @link  com.termux and so all their APKs installed on a device must have been signed with the same signature key to work together and so they must all be installed from the same source. Do not attempt to mix them together, i.e do not try to install an app or plugin from F-Droid and another one from a different source like GitHub. Android Package Manager will also normally not allow installation of APKs with different signatures and you will get errors on installation like App not installed, Failed to install due to an unknown error, INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE, INSTALL_FAILED_SHARED_USER_INCOMPATIBLE, signatures do not match previously installed version, etc. This restriction can be bypassed with root or with custom roms. If you wish to install from a different source, then you must uninstall any and all existing Termux or its plugin app APKs from your device first, then install all new APKs from the same new source. Check Uninstallation(uninstallation) section for details. You may also want to consider Backing up Termux @link  before the uninstallation so that you can restore it after re-installing from Termux different source.. In the following paragraphs, 'bootstrap' refers to the minimal packages that are shipped with the termux-app itself to start a working shell environment.

You can download the Termux APK directly from the site by clicking the Download APK link at the bottom of each version section. It usually takes a few days (or even a week or more) for updates to be available on F-Droid once an update has been released on GitHub. The F-Droid releases are built and published by F-Droid once they detect @link  a new GitHub release. The Termux maintainers do not have any control over the building and publishing of the Termux apps on F-Droid. Moreover, the Termux maintainers also do not have access to the APK signing keys of F-Droid releases, so we cannot release an APK ourselves on GitHub that would be compatible with F-Droid releases. The F-Droid app often may not notify you of updates and you will manually have to do a pull down swipe action in the Updates tab of the app for it to check updates. Make sure battery optimizations are disabled for the app, check  @link for details on how to do that. Only a universal APK is released, which will work on all supported architectures.

These are automatically attached when a new version is released. The APKs for GitHub Build action workflows will be listed under Artifacts section of a workflow run. These are created for each commit/push done to the repository and can be used by users who don't want to wait for releases and want to try out the latest features immediately or want to test their pull requests. Note that for action workflows, you need to be logged into a GitHub account @link  for the Artifacts links to be enabled/clickable. If you are using the GitHub app @link , then make sure to open workflow link in a browser like Chrome or Firefox that has your GitHub account logged in since the in-app browser may not be logged in.

There is currently a build of Termux available on Google Play for Android 11 devices, with extensive adjustments in order to pass policy requirements there. This is under development and has missing functionality and bugs (see here @link  for status updates) compared to the stable F-Droid build, which is why most users who can should still use F-Droid or GitHub build as mentioned above. Currently, Google Play will try to update installations away from F-Droid ones. Updating will still fail as sharedUserId @link  has been removed. A planned 0.118.1 F-Droid release will fix this by setting a higher version code than used for the PlayStore app. Meanwhile, to prevent Google Play from attempting to download and then fail to install the Google Play releases over existing installations, you can open the Termux apps pages on Google Play and then click on the 3 dots options button in the top right and then disable the Enable auto update toggle. However, the Termux apps updates will still show in the PlayStore app updates list.. If you want to help out with testing the Google Play build (or cannot install Termux from other sources), be aware that it's built from a separate repository  @link  - be sure to report issues there @link , as any issues encountered might very well be specific to that repository."

2190,44804216,3,Java,"Debugging. You can help debug problems of the Termux app and its plugins by setting appropriate logcat Log Level in Termux app settings -  - Debugging - Log Level (Requires Termux app version  0.118.0). The Log Level defaults to Normal and log level Verbose currently logs additional information. Its best to revert log level to Normal after you have finished debugging since private data may otherwise be passed to logcat during normal operation and moreover, additional logging increases execution time. The plugin apps do not execute the commands themselves but send execution intents to Termux app, which has its own log level which can be set in Termux app settings - Termux - Debugging - Log Level. So you must set log level for both Termux and the respective plugin app settings to get all the info. Once log levels have been set, you can run the logcat command in Termux app terminal to view the logs in realtime (Ctrlc to stop) or use logcat -d  logcat.txt to take a dump of the log. You can also view the logs from a PC over ADB. For more information, check official android logcat guide here @link . Moreover, users can generate termux files stat info and logcat dump automatically too with terminal's long hold options menu More - Report Issue option and selecting YES in the prompt shown to add debug info. This can be helpful for reporting and debugging other issues. If the report generated is too large, then Save To File option in context menu (3 dots on top right) of ReportActivity can be used and the file viewed/shared instead. Users must post complete report (optionally without sensitive info) when reporting issues. Issues opened with (partial) screenshots of error reports instead of text will likely be automatically closed/deleted."

It was created to allow for the removal of all hardcoded paths in the Termux app. Some of the termux plugins are using this as well and rest will in future. If you are contributing code that is using a constant or a util that may be shared, then define it in termux-shared library if it currently doesn't exist and reference it from there. Update the relevant changelogs as well. Pull requests using hardcoded values will/should not be accepted. Termux app and plugin specific classes must be added under com.termux.shared.termux package and general classes outside it.

2195,4576305,1,Java,"zipkin. @link @link @link Zipkin @link  is a distributed tracing system. It helps gather timing data needed to troubleshoot latency problems in service architectures. Features include both the collection and lookup of this data. If you have a trace ID in a log file, you can jump directly to it. Otherwise, you can query based on attributes such as service, operation name, tags and duration. Some interesting data will be summarized for you, such as the percentage of time spent in a service, and whether operations failed. The Zipkin UI also presents a dependency diagram showing how many traced requests went through each application. This can be helpful for identifying aggregate behavior including error paths or calls to deprecated services. Application’s need to be “instrumented” to report trace data to Zipkin. This usually means configuration of a tracer or instrumentation library @link . The most popular ways to report data to Zipkin are via http or Kafka, though many other options exist, such as Apache ActiveMQ, gRPC and RabbitMQ. The data served to the UI is stored in-memory, or persistently with a supported backend such as Apache Cassandra or Elasticsearch."
2196,4576305,2,Java,"Quick-start. The quickest way to get started is to fetch the latest released server @link  as a self-contained executable jar. Note that the Zipkin server requires minimum JRE 17. For example: @Code You can also start Zipkin via Docker. @Code Once the server is running, you can view traces with the Zipkin UI at  @link If your applications aren't sending traces, yet, configure them with Zipkin instrumentation @link  or try one of our examples @link .

2237,49876476,3,Java,"OVERVIEW. Apache ShardingSphere is a distributed SQL transaction & query engine that allows for data sharding, scaling, encryption, and more - on any database. Our community's guiding development concept is Database Plus for creating a complete ecosystem that allows you to transform any database into a distributed database system. It focuses on repurposing existing databases, by placing a standardized upper layer above existing and fragmented databases, rather than creating a new database. The goal is to provide unified database services and minimize or eliminate the challenges caused by underlying databases' fragmentation. This results in applications only needing to communicate with a single standardized service. The concepts at the core of the project are Connect, Enhance and Pluggable. - Connect: Flexible adaptation of database protocol, SQL dialect and database storage. It can quickly connect applications and heterogeneous databases. - Enhance: Capture database access entry to provide additional features transparently, such as: redirect (sharding, readwrite-splitting and shadow), transform (data encrypt and mask), authentication (security, audit and authority), governance (circuit breaker and access limitation and analyze, QoS and observability). - Pluggable: Leveraging the micro kernel and 3 layers pluggable mode, features and database ecosystem can be embedded flexibly. Developers can customize their ShardingSphere just like building with LEGO blocks. ShardingSphere became an Apache @link  Top-Level Project on April 16, 2020.. So far, ShardingSphere has been used by over 10,000 projects on GitHub @link ."

It's widely used to build languages, tools, and frameworks.

2249,501687,2,Java,"Versioning. ANTLR 4 supports 10 target languages (Cpp, CSharp, Dart, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python3, Swift, TypeScript), and ensuring consistency across these targets is a unique and highly valuable feature. To ensure proper support of this feature, each release of ANTLR is a complete release of the tool and the 10 runtimes, all with the same version. As such, ANTLR versioning does not strictly follow semver semantics: a component may be released with the latest version number even though nothing has changed within that component since the previous release major version is bumped only when ANTLR is rewritten for a totally new 'generation', such as ANTLR3 - ANTLR4 (LL(\) - ALL(\) parsing) minor version updates may include minor breaking changes, the policy is to regenerate parsers with every release (4.11 - 4.12) backwards compatibility is only guaranteed for patch version bumps (4.11.1 - 4.11.2) If you use a semver verifier in your CI, you probably want to apply special rules for ANTLR, such as treating minor change as a major change."

2263,53127403,1,Java,"Features. Unified management of the configurations of different environments and different clusters Apollo provides a unified interface to centrally manage the configurations of different environments, different clusters, and different namespaces The same codebase could have different configurations when deployed in different clusters With the namespace concept, it is easy to support multiple applications to share the same configurations, while also allowing them to customize the configurations Multiple languages is provided in user interface(currently Chinese and English) Configuration changes takes effect in real time (hot release) After the user modified the configuration and released it in Apollo, the sdk will receive the latest configurations in real time (1 second) and notify the application Release version management Every configuration releases are versioned, which is friendly to support configuration rollback Grayscale release Support grayscale configuration release, for example, after clicking release, it will only take effect for some application instances. After a period of observation, we could push the configurations to all application instances if there is no problem Authorization management, release approval and operation audit Great authorization mechanism is designed for applications and configurations management, and the management of configurations is divided into two operations: editing and publishing, therefore greatly reducing human errors All operations have audit logs for easy tracking of problems Client side configuration information monitoring It's very easy to see which instances are using the configurations and what versions they are using Rich SDKs available Provides native sdks of Java and .Net to facilitate application integration Support Spring Placeholder, Annotation and Spring Boot ConfigurationProperties for easy application use (requires Spring 3.1.1) Http APIs are provided, so non-Java and .Net applications can integrate conveniently Rich third party sdks are also available, e.g. Golang, Python, NodeJS, PHP, C, etc Open platform API Apollo itself provides a unified configuration management interface, which supports features such as multi-environment, multi-data center configuration management, permissions, and process governance However, for the sake of versatility, Apollo will not put too many restrictions on the modification of the configuration, as long as it conforms to the basic format, it can be saved. In our research, we found that for some users, their configurations may have more complicated formats, such as xml, json, and the format needs to be verified There are also some users such as DAL, which not only have a specific format, but also need to verify the entered value before saving, such as checking whether the database, username and password match For this type of application, Apollo allows the application to modify and release configurations through open APIs, which has great authorization and permission control mechanism built in Simple deployment As an infrastructure service, the configuration center has very high availability requirements, which forces Apollo to rely on external dependencies as little as possible Currently, the only external dependency is MySQL, so the deployment is very simple. Apollo can run as long as Java and MySQL are installed Apollo also provides a packaging script, which can generate all required installation packages with just one click, and supports customization of runtime parameters"

2307,6766558,1,Java,"Hystrix Status. Hystrix is no longer in active development, and is currently in maintenance mode. Hystrix (at version 1.5.18) is stable enough to meet the needs of Netflix for our existing applications. Meanwhile, our focus has shifted towards more adaptive implementations that react to an application’s real time performance rather than pre-configured settings (for example, through adaptive concurrency limits @link ). For the cases where something like Hystrix makes sense, we intend to continue using Hystrix for existing applications, and to leverage open and active projects like resilience4j @link  for new internal projects. We are beginning to recommend others do the same. Netflix Hystrix is now officially in maintenance mode, with the following expectations to the greater community: Netflix will no longer actively review issues, merge pull-requests, and release new versions of Hystrix. We have made a final release of Hystrix (1.5.18) per issue 1891 @link  so that the latest version in Maven Central is aligned with the last known stable version used internally at Netflix (1.5.11). If members of the community are interested in taking ownership of Hystrix and moving it back into active mode, please reach out to hystrixoss@googlegroups.com. Hystrix has served Netflix and the community well over the years, and the transition to maintenance mode is in no way an indication that the concepts and ideas from Hystrix are no longer valuable. On the contrary, Hystrix has inspired many great ideas and projects. We thank everyone at Netflix, and in the greater community, for all the contributions made to Hystrix over the years."

2337,7508411,4,Java,"Upstream, downstream. The dataflows in RxJava consist of a source, zero or more intermediate steps followed by a data consumer or combinator step (where the step is responsible to consume the dataflow by some means): @Code Here, if we imagine ourselves on operator2, looking to the left towards the source is called the upstream. Looking to the right towards the subscriber/consumer is called the downstream. This is often more apparent when each element is written on a separate line: @Code"
2338,7508411,4,Java,"Objects in motion. In RxJava's documentation, emission, emits, item, event, signal, data and message are considered synonyms and represent the object traveling along the dataflow."
2339,7508411,4,Java,"Backpressure. When the dataflow runs through asynchronous steps, each step may perform different things with different speed. To avoid overwhelming such steps, which usually would manifest itself as increased memory usage due to temporary buffering or the need for skipping/dropping data, so-called backpressure is applied, which is a form of flow control where the steps can express how many items are they ready to process. This allows constraining the memory usage of the dataflows in situations where there is generally no way for a step to know how many items the upstream will send to it. In RxJava, the dedicated Flowable class is designated to support backpressure and Observable is dedicated to the non-backpressured operations (short sequences, GUI interactions, etc.). The other types, Single, Maybe and Completable don't support backpressure nor should they; there is always room to store one item temporarily."
2340,7508411,4,Java,"Assembly time. The preparation of dataflows by applying various intermediate operators happens in the so-called assembly time: @Code At this point, the data is not flowing yet and no side-effects are happening."
2341,7508411,4,Java,Subscription time. This is a temporary state when subscribe() is called on a flow that establishes the chain of processing steps internally: @Code This is when the subscription side-effects are triggered (see doOnSubscribe). Some sources block or start emitting items right away in this state.
2342,7508411,4,Java,"Runtime. This is the state when the flows are actively emitting items, errors or completion signals: @Code Practically, this is when the body of the given example above executes."
2343,7508411,3,Java,"Simple background computation. One of the common use cases for RxJava is to run some computation, network request on a background thread and show the results (or error) on the UI thread: @Code Typically, you can move computations or blocking IO to some other thread via subscribeOn. Once the data is ready, you can make sure they get processed on the foreground or GUI thread via observeOn."
2344,7508411,3,Java,"Schedulers. RxJava operators don't work with Threads or ExecutorServices directly but with so-called Schedulers that abstract away sources of concurrency behind a uniform API. RxJava 3 features several standard schedulers accessible via Schedulers utility class. - Schedulers.computation(): Run computation intensive work on a fixed number of dedicated threads in the background. Most asynchronous operators use this as their default Scheduler. - Schedulers.io(): Run I/O-like or blocking operations on a dynamically changing set of threads. - Schedulers.single(): Run work on a single thread in a sequential and FIFO manner. - Schedulers.trampoline(): Run work in a sequential and FIFO manner in one of the participating threads, usually for testing purposes. These are available on all JVM platforms but some specific platforms, such as Android, have their own typical Schedulers defined: AndroidSchedulers.mainThread(), SwingScheduler.instance() or JavaFXScheduler.platform(). In addition, there is an option to wrap an existing Executor (and its subtypes such as ExecutorService) into a Scheduler via Schedulers.from(Executor). This can be used, for example, to have a larger but still fixed pool of threads (unlike computation() and io() respectively). The Thread.sleep(2000); at the end is no accident. In RxJava the default Schedulers run on daemon threads, which means once the Java main thread exits, they all get stopped and background computations may never happen. Sleeping for some time in this example situations lets you see the output of the flow on the console with time to spare."
2345,7508411,3,Java,"Concurrency within a flow. Flows in RxJava are sequential in nature split into processing stages that may run concurrently with each other: @Code This example flow squares the numbers from 1 to 10 on the computation Scheduler and consumes the results on the 'main' thread (more precisely, the caller thread of blockingSubscribe). However, the lambda v - v  v doesn't run in parallel for this flow; it receives the values 1 to 10 on the same computation thread one after the other."
2346,7508411,3,Java,"Parallel processing. Processing the numbers 1 to 10 in parallel is a bit more involved: @Code Practically, parallelism in RxJava means running independent flows and merging their results back into a single flow. The operator flatMap does this by first mapping each number from 1 to 10 into its own individual Flowable, runs them and merges the computed squares. Note, however, that flatMap doesn't guarantee any order and the items from the inner flows may end up interleaved. There are alternative operators: - concatMap that maps and runs one inner flow at a time and - concatMapEager which runs all inner flows 'at once' but the output flow will be in the order those inner flows were created. Alternatively, the Flowable.parallel() operator and the ParallelFlowable type help achieve the same parallel processing pattern: @Code"
2347,7508411,3,Java,"Dependent sub-flows. flatMap is a powerful operator and helps in a lot of situations. For example, given a service that returns a Flowable, we'd like to call another service with values emitted by the first service: @Code"
2348,7508411,3,Java,"Continuations. Sometimes, when an item has become available, one would like to perform some dependent computations on it. This is sometimes called continuations and, depending on what should happen and what types are involved, may involve various operators to accomplish."
2349,7508411,4,Java,"Dependent. The most typical scenario is to given a value, invoke another service, await and continue with its result: @Code It is often the case also that later sequences would require values from earlier mappings. This can be achieved by moving the outer flatMap into the inner parts of the previous flatMap for example: @Code Here, the original value will be available inside the inner flatMap, courtesy of lambda variable capture."
2350,7508411,4,Java,"Non-dependent. In other scenarios, the result(s) of the first source/dataflow is irrelevant and one would like to continue with a quasi independent another source. Here, flatMap works as well: @Code however, the continuation in this case stays Observable instead of the likely more appropriate Single. (This is understandable because from the perspective of flatMapSingle, sourceObservable is a multi-valued source and thus the mapping may result in multiple values as well). Often though there is a way that is somewhat more expressive (and also lower overhead) by using Completable as the mediator and its operator andThen to resume with something else: @Code The only dependency between the sourceObservable and the someSingleSource is that the former should complete normally in order for the latter to be consumed."
2351,7508411,4,Java,"Deferred-dependent. Sometimes, there is an implicit data dependency between the previous sequence and the new sequence that, for some reason, was not flowing through the 'regular channels'. One would be inclined to write such continuations as follows: @Code Unfortunately, this prints 0 because Single.just(count.get()) is evaluated at assembly time when the dataflow hasn't even run yet. We need something that defers the evaluation of this Single source until runtime when the main source completes: @Code or @Code"
2352,7508411,3,Java,"Type conversions. Sometimes, a source or service returns a different type than the flow that is supposed to work with it. For example, in the inventory example above, getDemandAsync could return a Single. If the code example is left unchanged, this will result in a compile-time error (however, often with a misleading error message about lack of overload). In such situations, there are usually two options to fix the transformation: 1) convert to the desired type or 2) find and use an overload of the specific operator supporting the different type."
2353,7508411,4,Java,"Converting to the desired type. Each reactive base class features operators that can perform such conversions, including the protocol conversions, to match some other type. The following matrix shows the available conversion options: 1: When turning a multi-valued source into a single-valued source, one should decide which of the many source values should be considered as the result. 2: Turning an Observable into Flowable requires an additional decision: what to do with the potential unconstrained flow of the source Observable? There are several strategies available (such as buffering, dropping, keeping the latest) via the BackpressureStrategy parameter or via standard Flowable operators such as onBackpressureBuffer, onBackpressureDrop, onBackpressureLatest which also allow further customization of the backpressure behavior. 3: When there is only (at most) one source item, there is no problem with backpressure as it can be always stored until the downstream is ready to consume."
2354,7508411,4,Java,"Using an overload with the desired type. Many frequently used operator has overloads that can deal with the other types. These are usually named with the suffix of the target type: The reason these operators have a suffix instead of simply having the same name with different signature is type erasure. Java doesn't consider signatures such as operator(Function) and operator(Function) different (unlike C) and due to erasure, the two operators would end up as duplicate methods with the same signature.."
2355,7508411,3,Java,"Operator naming conventions. Naming in programming is one of the hardest things as names are expected to be not long, expressive, capturing and easily memorable. Unfortunately, the target language (and pre-existing conventions) may not give too much help in this regard (unusable keywords, type erasure, type ambiguities, etc.)."
2356,7508411,4,Java,"Unusable keywords. In the original Rx.NET, the operator that emits a single item and then completes is called Return(T). Since the Java convention is to have a lowercase letter start a method name, this would have been return(T) which is a keyword in Java and thus not available. Therefore, RxJava chose to name this operator just(T). The same limitation exists for the operator Switch, which had to be named switchOnNext. Yet another example is Catch which was named onErrorResumeNext."
2357,7508411,4,Java,Type erasure. Many operators that expect the user to provide some function returning a reactive type can't be overloaded because the type erasure around a Function turns such method signatures into duplicates. RxJava chose to name such operators by appending the type as suffix as well: @Code
2358,7508411,4,Java,"Type ambiguities. Even though certain operators have no problems from type erasure, their signature may turn up being ambiguous, especially if one uses Java 8 and lambdas. For example, there are several overloads of concatWith taking the various other reactive base types as arguments (for providing convenience and performance benefits in the underlying implementation): @Code Both Publisher and SingleSource appear as functional interfaces (types with one abstract method) and may encourage users to try to provide a lambda expression: @Code Unfortunately, this approach doesn't work and the example does not print 2 at all. In fact, since version 2.1.10, it doesn't even compile because at least 4 concatWith overloads exist and the compiler finds the code above ambiguous. The user in such situations probably wanted to defer some computation until the someSource has completed, thus the correct unambiguous operator should have been defer: @Code Sometimes, a suffix is added to avoid logical ambiguities that may compile but produce the wrong type in a flow: @Code This can get also ambiguous when functional interface types get involved as the type argument T."
2359,7508411,4,Java,"Error handling. Dataflows can fail, at which point the error is emitted to the consumer(s). Sometimes though, multiple sources may fail at which point there is a choice whether or not wait for all of them to complete or fail. To indicate this opportunity, many operator names are suffixed with the DelayError words (while others feature a delayError or delayErrors boolean flag in one of their overloads): @Code Of course, suffixes of various kinds may appear together: @Code"
2360,7508411,4,Java,"Base class vs base type. The base classes can be considered heavy due to the sheer number of static and instance methods on them. RxJava 3's design was heavily influenced by the Reactive Streams @link  specification, therefore, the library features a class and an interface per each reactive type:. 1The org.reactivestreams.Publisher is part of the external Reactive Streams library. It is the main type to interact with other reactive libraries through a standardized mechanism governed by the Reactive Streams specification @link .. 2The naming convention of the interface was to append Source to the semi-traditional class name. There is no FlowableSource since Publisher is provided by the Reactive Streams library (and subtyping it wouldn't have helped with interoperation either). These interfaces are, however, not standard in the sense of the Reactive Streams specification and are currently RxJava specific only."
2361,7508411,3,Java,"R8 and ProGuard settings. By default, RxJava itself doesn't require any ProGuard/R8 settings and should work without problems. Unfortunately, the Reactive Streams dependency since version 1.0.3 has embedded Java 9 class files in its JAR that can cause warnings with the plain ProGuard: @Code It is recommended one sets up the following -dontwarn entry in the application's proguard-ruleset file: @Code For R8, the RxJava jar includes the META-INF/proguard/rxjava3.pro with the same no-warning clause and should apply automatically."

2395,7613257,4,Java,Using Dev Container. As an alternative you can build a Dev Container @link  - basically a docker container - suitable for building and testing Selenium using the devcontainer.json in the .devcontainer(.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) directory.

2396,7613257,4,Java,Using Docker Image. You can also build a Docker image suitable for building and testing Selenium using the Dockerfile in the dev image(scripts/dev-image/Dockerfile) directory.
2397,7613257,2,Java,"Building. Selenium is built using a common build tool called Bazel @link , to allow us to easily manage dependency downloads, generate required binaries, build and release packages, and execute tests; all in a fast, efficient manner. For a more detailed discussion, read Simon Stewart's article on Building Selenium @link Often we wrap Bazel commands with our custom Rake @link  wrapper. These are run with the ./go command. The common Bazel commands are: bazel build — evaluates dependencies, compiles source files and generates output files for the specified target. It's used to create executable binaries, libraries, or other artifacts. bazel run — builds the target and then executes it. It's typically used for targets that produce executable binaries. bazel test — builds and runs the target in a context with additional testing functionality bazel query — identifies available targets for the provided path. Each module that can be built is defined in a BUILD.bazel file. To execute the module you refer to it starting with a //, then include the relative path to the file that defines it, then :, then the name of the target. For example, the target to build the Grid is named executable-grid and it is defined in the 'selenium/java/src/org/openqa/selenium/grid/BAZEL.build' file. So to build the grid you would run: bazel build //java/src/org/openqa/selenium/grid:executable-grid. The Bazel documentation has a handy guide @link . for various shortcuts and all the ways to build multiple targets, which Selenium makes frequent use of. To build everything for a given language: @Code To build just the grid there is an alias name to use (the log will show where the output jar is located): @Code To make things more simple, building each of the bindings is available with this ./go command @Code"
2398,7613257,4,Java,"IntelliJ. Most of the team uses Intellij for their day-to-day editing. If you're working in IntelliJ, then we highly recommend installing the Bazel IJ plugin @link  which is documented on its own site @link . To use Selenium with the IntelliJ Bazel plugin, import the repository as a Bazel project, and select the project view file from the scripts(scripts) directory. ij.bazelproject for Mac/Linux and ij-win.bazelproject for Windows."

In the same directory run the command sdkmanager --licenses (or ./sdkmanager --licenses if on linux/mac) 4. Set the ANDROID_HOME environment variable to point to your unzipped Android SDK directory. 5. Enable developer mode on your device/emulator. If you are on testing on a phone you can follow these instructions @link , otherwise you need to google how to enable your emulator's developer mode specifically.. 6. Run gradlew android:assembleDebug (or ./gradlew if on linux/mac). This will create an unsigned APK in android/build/outputs/apk.

To revert this value to the default, use: git config --global http.postBuffer 1000000 The Courses Here's the new 'Learn Spring' course: LEARN SPRING - THE MASTER CLASS @link . Here's the Master Class of 'REST With Spring' (along with the new announced Boot 2 material): THE REST WITH SPRING - MASTER CLASS @link . And here's the Master Class of 'Learn Spring Security': LEARN SPRING SECURITY - MASTER CLASS @link . Java and Spring Tutorials This project is a collection of small and focused tutorials - each covering a single and well defined area of development in the Java ecosystem. A strong focus of these is, of course, the Spring Framework - Spring, Spring Boot and Spring Security. In addition to Spring, the modules here cover a number of aspects of Java. Profile based segregation We are using maven build profiles to segregate the huge list of individual projects we have in our repository. The projects are broadly divided into 3 lists: default, default-jdk8 and default-heavy. Next, they are segregated further on the basis of the tests that we want to execute. Additionally, there are 2 profiles dedicated for JDK17 and above builds - which require JDK 17. We also have a parents profile to build only parent modules. Therefore, we have a total of 7 profiles: Building the project Though it should not be needed often to build the entire repository at once because we are usually concerned with a specific module. But if we want to, we can invoke the below command from the root of the repository if we want to build the entire repository with only Unit Tests enabled: mvn clean install -Pdefault,default-heavy or if we want to build the entire repository with Integration Tests enabled, we can do: mvn clean install -Pintegration,integration-heavy Analogously, for the JDK8 projects the commands are: mvn clean install -Pdefault-jdk8 and mvn clean install -Pintegration-jdk8 Building a single module To build a specific module, run the command: mvn clean install in the module directory. It can happen that your module is part of a parent module e.g. parent-boot-1,parent-spring-5 etc, then you will need to build the parent module first so that you can build your module. We have created a parents profile that you can use to build just the parent modules, just run the profile as: mvn clean install -Pparents Building modules from the root of the repository To build specific modules from the root of the repository, run the command: mvn clean install --pl akka-modules,algorithms-modules -Pdefault in the root directory. Here akka-modules and algorithms-modules are the modules that we want to build and default is the maven profile in which these modules are present. Running a Spring Boot module To run a Spring Boot module, run the command: mvn spring-boot:run in the module directory. Working with the IDE This repo contains a large number of modules. When you're working with an individual module, there's no need to import all of them (or build all of them) - you can simply import that particular module in either Eclipse or IntelliJ. Running Tests The command mvn clean install from within a module will run the unit tests in that module. For Spring modules this will also run the SpringContextTest if present. To run the integration tests, use the command: mvn clean install -Pintegration or mvn clean install -Pintegration-heavy or mvn clean install -Pintegration-jdk8 depending on the list where our module exists"

2469,10270250,1,JavaScript,"React @link  &middot;  @link   @link   @link   @link . React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Declarative: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug. Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.

We hope that all markdown lovers will contribute their own code and help develop MarkText into a popular markdown editor. 3. There are many markdown editors and all have their own merits, some have features which others don't.

Check if using Cookie Remover (Google Chrome version @link  or Mozilla Firefox version @link ) can bypass the paywall. If not, continue to the next step. 3. First search Issues @link  to see if the site has been requested already. 4. Visit an article on the site you want to bypass the paywall for and copy the article title. 5. Open up a new incognito window (CtrlShiftN on Chrome) or Private window (CtrlShiftP on Firefox), and paste the article title into Google. 6.

These can be written as normal functions that take a props argument and return a JSX element. @Code Tip: You might use Paul Shen's VS Code Extension @link  to automate the type destructure declaration (incl a keyboard shortcut @link ). Why is React.FC not needed? What about React.FunctionComponent/React.VoidFunctionComponent? You may see this in many ReactTypeScript codebases: @Code However, the general consensus today is that React.FunctionComponent (or the shorthand React.FC) is not needed. If you're still using React 17 or TypeScript lower than 5.1, it is even discouraged @link . This is a nuanced opinion of course, but if you agree and want to remove React.FC from your codebase, you can use this jscodeshift codemod @link . Some differences from the 'normal function' version: - React.FunctionComponent is explicit about the return type, while the normal function version is implicit (or else needs additional annotation). - It provides typechecking and autocomplete for static properties like displayName, propTypes, and defaultProps. - Note that there are some known issues using defaultProps with React.FunctionComponent. See this issue for details @link . We maintain a separate defaultProps section you can also look up. - Before the React 18 type updates @link , React.FunctionComponent provided an implicit definition of children (see below), which was heavily debated and is one of the reasons React.FC was removed from the Create React App TypeScript template @link . @Code (Deprecated)Using React.VoidFunctionComponent or React.VFC instead In @types/react 16.9.48 @link , the React.VoidFunctionComponent or React.VFC type was added for typing children explicitly. However, please be aware that React.VFC and React.VoidFunctionComponent were deprecated in React 18  @link , so this interim solution is no longer necessary or recommended in React 18. Please use regular function components or React.FC instead. @Code - _In the future_, it may automatically mark props as readonly, though that's a moot point if the props object is destructured in the parameter list. In most cases it makes very little difference which syntax is used, but you may prefer the more explicit nature of React.FunctionComponent."
2545,135786093,4,JavaScript,Hooks. Hooks are supported in @types/react from v16.8 up @link ..
2546,135786093,4,JavaScript,"useState. Type inference works very well for simple values: @Code See also the Using Inferred Types @link  section if you need to use a complex type that you've relied on inference for.. However, many hooks are initialized with null-ish default values, and you may wonder how to provide types. Explicitly declare the type, and use a union type: @Code You can also use type assertions if a state is initialized soon after setup and always has a value after: @Code This temporarily 'lies' to the TypeScript compiler that {} is of type User. You should follow up by setting the user state — if you don't, the rest of your code may rely on the fact that user is of type User and that may lead to runtime errors."
2547,135786093,4,JavaScript,"useCallback. You can type the useCallback just like any other function. @Code Note that for React  any( callback: T, deps: DependencyList ): T; @Code ts function useCallback(callback: T, deps: DependencyList): T; @Code"

Don't forget to define the return type of reducer, otherwise TypeScript will infer it.. @Code View in the TypeScript Playground @link . Usage with Reducer from redux In case you use the redux @link  library to write reducer function, It provides a convenient helper of the format Reducer which takes care of the return type for you. So the above reducer example becomes: @Code"
2549,135786093,4,JavaScript,"useEffect / useLayoutEffect. Both of useEffect and useLayoutEffect are used for performing side effects and return an optional cleanup function which means if they don't deal with returning values, no types are necessary. When using useEffect, take care not to return anything other than a function or undefined, otherwise both TypeScript and React will yell at you. This can be subtle when using arrow functions: @Code Solution to the above example @Code"
2550,135786093,4,JavaScript,"useRef. In TypeScript, useRef returns a reference that is either read-only @link  or mutable @link , depends on whether your type argument fully covers the initial value or not. Choose one that suits your use case.."
2551,135786093,5,JavaScript,"Option 1: DOM element ref. To access a DOM element @link : provide only the element type as argument, and use null as initial value. In this case, the returned reference will have a read-only .current that is managed by React. TypeScript expects you to give this ref to an element's ref prop: @Code If you are sure that divRef.current will never be null, it is also possible to use the non-null assertion operator !: @Code Note that you are opting out of type safety here - you will have a runtime error if you forget to assign the ref to an element in the render, or if the ref-ed element is conditionally rendered. Tip: Choosing which HTMLElement to use Refs demand specificity - it is not enough to just specify any old HTMLElement. If you don't know the name of the element type you need, you can check lib.dom.ts @link  or make an intentional type error and let the language service tell you:."

2556,135786093,4,JavaScript,"Custom Hooks. If you are returning an array in your Custom Hook, you will want to avoid type inference as TypeScript will infer a union type (when you actually want different types in each position of the array). Instead, use TS 3.4 const assertions @link :. @Code View in the TypeScript Playground @link . This way, when you destructure you actually get the right types based on destructure position. Alternative: Asserting a tuple return type If you are having trouble with const assertions @link , you can also assert or define the function return types: @Code A helper function that automatically types tuples can also be helpful if you write a lot of custom hooks: @Code Note that the React team recommends that custom hooks that return more than two values should use proper objects instead of tuples, however."

2559,135786093,4,JavaScript,"Class Components. Within TypeScript, React.Component is a generic type (aka React.Component), so you want to provide it with (optional) prop and state type parameters: @Code View in the TypeScript Playground @link . Don't forget that you can export/import/extend these types/interfaces for reuse. Why annotate state twice? It isn't strictly necessary to annotate the state class property, but it allows better type inference when accessing this.state and also initializing the state. This is because they work in two different ways, the 2nd generic type parameter will allow this.setState() to work correctly, because that method comes from the base class, but initializing state inside the component overrides the base implementation so you have to make sure that you tell the compiler that you're not actually doing anything different. See commentary by @ferdaber here @link . No need for readonly You often see sample code include readonly to mark props and state immutable: @Code This is not necessary as React.Component already marks them as immutable.

The problem here is that the way GreetProps is defined, age is a required prop when it isn't because of defaultProps. The insight to have here is that GreetProps is the _internal_ contract for your component, not the _external_, consumer facing contract @link . You could create a separate type specifically for export, or you could make use of the React.JSX.LibraryManagedAttributes utility:. @Code This will work properly, although hovering overApparentGreetPropsmay be a little intimidating.

TypeScript 2.9 and earlier For TypeScript 2.9 and earlier, there's more than one way to do it, but this is the best advice we've yet seen: @Code Our former recommendation used the Partial type feature in TypeScript, which means that the current interface will fulfill a partial version on the wrapped interface. In that way we can extend defaultProps without any changes in the types! @Code The problem with this approach is it causes complex issues with the type inference working with React.JSX.LibraryManagedAttributes.

Alternatively, here is another great tutorial for complete beginners - Getting Started With Node.js, Express, MongoDB @link . Getting Started --------------- Step 1: The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository: @Code Note: I highly recommend installing Nodemon @link . It watches for any changes in your  node.js app and automatically restarts the server. Once installed, instead of node app.js use nodemon app.js. It will save you a lot of time in the long run, because you won't need to manually restart the server each time you make a small change in code. To install, run sudo npm install -g nodemon. Step 2: Obtain API Keys and change configs if needed After completing step 1 and locally installing MongoDB, you should be able to access the application through a web browser and use local user accounts. However, certain functions like API integrations may not function correctly until you obtain specific keys from service providers. The keys provided in the project serve as placeholders, and you can retain them for features you are not currently utilizing. To incorporate the acquired keys into the application, you have two options: 1.  Set environment variables in your console session: Alternatively, you can set the keys as environment variables directly through the command prompt. For instance, in bash, you can use the export command like this: export FACEBOOK_SECRETxxxxxx. This method is considered a better practice as it reduces the risk of accidentally including your secrets in a code repository. 2. Replace the keys in the .env.example file: Open the .env.example file and update the placeholder keys with the newly acquired ones. This method has the risk of accidental checking-in of your secrets to code repos. What to get and configure: - SMTP - For user workflows for reset password and verify email - For contact form processing - reCAPTCHA - For contact form submission - OAuth for social logins (Sign in with / Login with) - Depending on your application need, obtain keys from Google, Facebook, X (Twitter), LinkedIn, Twitch, GitHub, Snapchat.  You don't have to obtain valid keys for any provider that you don't need. Just remove the buttons and links in the login and account pug views before your demo. - API keys for service providers in the API Examples if you are planning to use them. - MongoDB Atlas - If you are using MongoDB Atlas instead of a local db, set the MONGODB_URI to your db URI (including your db user/password). - Email address - Set SITE_CONTACT_EMAIL as your incoming email address for messages sent to you thru the contact form. - Set TRANSACTION_EMAIL as the 'From' address for emails sent to users thru the lost password or email verification emails to users.  You may set this to the same address as SITE_CONTACT_EMAIL. - ngrok and HTTPS If you want to use some API that needs HTTPS to work (for example Pinterest or Facebook), you will need to download ngrok @link . Start ngrok, set your BASE_URL to the forwarding address  (i.e   @link ), and use the forwarding address to access your application.  If you are using a proxy like ngrok, you may get a CSRF mismatch error if you try to access the app at  @link instead of the  @link address. After installing or downloading the standalone ngrok client you can start ngrok to intercept the data exchanged on port 8080 with ./ngrok http 8080 in Linux or ngrok http 8080 in Windows. Step 3: Develop your application and customize the experience - Check out How It Works(how-it-works-mini-guides). Step 4: Optional - deploy to production See: - Deployment(deployment). -  prod-checklist.md @link"
2610,14370955,1,JavaScript,"Obtaining API Keys. You will need to obtain appropriate credentials (Client ID, Client Secret, API Key, or Username & Password) for API and service provides which you need.  See Step 2 in the Getting started section for more info."
2611,14370955,2,JavaScript,"SMTP. Obtain SMTP credentials from a provider for transactional emails.  Set the SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASSWORD, and SMTP_HOST environment variables accordingly.

It took me a long time to grasp the concept of exports and module.exports, let alone having a global app reference in other files. Tha to me is backward thinking.

2616,14370955,3,JavaScript,"Custom HTML and CSS Design 101. HTML5 UP @link  has many beautiful templates that you can download for free. When you download the ZIP file, it will come with index.html, images, CSS and js folders. So, how do you integrate it with Hackathon Starter? Hackathon Starter uses the Bootstrap CSS framework, but these templates do not. Trying to use both CSS files at the same time will likely result in undesired effects. Note: Using the custom templates approach, you should understand that you cannot reuse any of the views I have created: layout, the home page, API browser, login, signup, account management, contact. Those views were built using Bootstrap grid and styles. You will have to manually update the grid using a different syntax provided in the template. Having said that, you can mix and match if you want to do so: Use Bootstrap for the main app interface, and a custom template for a landing page. Let's start from the beginning. For this example I will use Escape Velocity @link  template: Note: For the sake of simplicity I will only consider index.html, and skip left-sidebar.html, no-sidebar.html, right-sidebar.html. Move all JavaScript files from html5up-escape-velocity/js to public/js. Then move all CSS files from html5up-escape-velocity/css to public/css. And finally, move all images from html5up-escape-velocity/images to public/images. You could move it to the existing img folder, but that would require manually changing every img reference. Grab the contents of index.html and paste it into HTML To Pug @link . Note: Do not forget to update all the CSS and JS paths accordingly. Create a new file escape-velocity.pug and paste the Pug markup in views folder. Whenever you see the code res.render('account/login') - that means it will search for views/account/login.pug file. Let's see how it looks. Create a new controller escapeVelocity inside controllers/home.js: @Code And then create a route in app.js. I placed it right after the index controller: @Code Restart the server (if you are not using nodemon); then you should see the new template at  @link I will stop right here, but if you would like to use this template as more than just a single page, take a look at how these Pug templates work: layout.pug - base template, index.pug - home page, partials/header.pug - Bootstrap navbar, partials/footer.pug - sticky footer. You will have to manually break it apart into smaller pieces. Figure out which part of the template you want to keep the same on all pages - that's your new layout.pug. Then, each page that changes, be it index.pug, about.pug, contact.pug will be embedded in your new layout.pug via block content. Use existing templates as a reference. This is a rather lengthy process, and templates you get from elsewhere might have yet another grid system. That's why I chose Bootstrap for the Hackathon Starter. Many people are already familiar with Bootstrap, plus it's easy to get started with it if you have never used Bootstrap. You can also buy many beautifully designed Bootstrap themes at Themeforest @link , and use them as a drop-in replacement for Hackathon Starter. However, if you would like to go with a completely custom HTML/CSS design, this should help you to get started!"
2617,14370955,3,JavaScript,"How do flash messages work in this project?. Flash messages allow you to display a message at the end of the request and access it on the next request and only the next request. For instance, on a failed login attempt, you would display an alert with some error message, but as soon as you refresh that page or visit a different page and come back to the login page, that error message will be gone. It is only displayed once. This project uses express-flash module for flash messages. And that module is built on top of connect-flash, which is what I used in this project initially. With express-flash you don't have to explicitly send a flash message to every view inside res.render(). All flash messages are available in your views via messages object by default, thanks to express-flash. Flash messages have a two-step process. You use req.flash('errors', { msg: 'Error messages goes here' } to create a flash message in your controllers, and then display them in your views: @Code In the first step, 'errors' is the name of a flash message, which should match the name of the property on messages object in your views. You place alert messages inside if message.errors because you don't want to show them flash messages are present. The reason why you pass an error like { msg: 'Error message goes here' } instead of just a string - 'Error message goes here', is for the sake of consistency. To clarify that, express-validator module which is used for validating and sanitizing user's input, returns all errors as an array of objects, where each object has a msg property with a message why an error has occurred. Here is a more general example of what express-validator returns when there are errors present: @Code To keep consistent with that style, you should pass all flash messages as { msg: 'My flash message' } instead of a string. Otherwise, you will see an alert box without an error message. That is because in partials/flash.pug template it will try to output error.msg (i.e. 'My flash message'.msg), in other words, it will try to call a msg method on a String object, which will return undefined. Everything I just mentioned about errors, also applies to 'info' and 'success' flash messages, and you could even create a new one yourself, such as: Data Usage Controller (Example) @Code User Account Page (Example) @Code partials/flash.pug is a partial template that contains how flash messages are formatted. Previously, flash messages were scattered throughout each view that used flash messages (contact, login, signup, profile), but now, thankfully it uses a DRY approach. The flash messages partial template is included in the layout.pug, along with footer and navigation. @Code If you have any further questions about flash messages, please feel free to open an issue, and I will update this mini-guide accordingly, or send a pull request if you would like to include something that I missed."
2618,14370955,3,JavaScript,"How do I create a new page?. A more correct way to say this would be 'How do I create a new route?' The main file app.js contains all the routes. Each route has a callback function associated with it. Sometimes you will see three or more arguments for a route. In a case like that, the first argument is still a URL string, while middle arguments are what's called middleware. Think of middleware as a door. If this door prevents you from continuing forward, you won't get to your callback function. One such example is a route that requires authentication. @Code It always goes from left to right. A user visits /account page. Then isAuthenticated middleware checks if you are authenticated: @Code If you are authenticated, you let this visitor pass through your 'door' by calling return next();. It then proceeds to the next middleware until it reaches the last argument, which is a callback function that typically renders a template on GET requests or redirects on POST requests. In this case, if you are authenticated, you will be redirected to the Account Management page; otherwise, you will be redirected to the Login page. @Code Express.js has app.get, app.post, app.put, app.delete, but for the most part, you will only use the first two HTTP verbs, unless you are building a RESTful API. If you just want to display a page, then use GET, if you are submitting a form, sending a file then use POST. Here is a typical workflow for adding new routes to your application. Let's say we are building a page that lists all books from the database. Step 1. Start by defining a route. @Code --- Note: As of Express 4.x you can define your routes like so: @Code And here is how a route would look if it required an authentication and an authorization middleware: @Code Use whichever style makes sense to you. Either one is acceptable. I think that chaining HTTP verbs on app.route is a very clean and elegant approach, but on the other hand, I can no longer see all my routes at a glance when you have one route per line. Step 2. Create a new schema and a model Book.js inside the models directory. @Code Step 3. Create a new controller file called book.js inside the controllers directory. @Code Step 4. Import that controller in app.js. @Code Step 5. Create books.pug template. @Code That's it! I will say that you could have combined Step 1, 2, 3 as following: @Code Sure, it's simpler, but as soon as you pass 1000 lines of code in app.js it becomes a little challenging to navigate the file. I mean, the whole point of this boilerplate project was to separate concerns, so you could work with your teammates without running into MERGE CONFLICTS. Imagine you have four developers working on a single app.js, I promise you it won't be fun resolving merge conflicts all the time. If you are the only developer, then it's okay. But as I said, once it gets up to a certain LoC size, it becomes difficult to maintain everything in a single file. That's all there is to it. Express.js is super simple to use. Most of the time you will be dealing with other APIs to do the real work: Mongoose @link  for querying database, socket.io for sending and receiving messages over WebSockets, sending emails via Nodemailer @link , form validation using validator.js @link  library, parsing websites using Cheerio @link , etc."
2619,14370955,3,JavaScript,"How do I use Socket.io with Hackathon Starter?. Dan Stroot @link  submitted an excellent pull request @link  that adds a real-time dashboard with socket.io. And as  much as I'd like to add it to the project, I think it violates one of the main principles of the Hackathon Starter: When I started this project, my primary focus was on simplicity and ease of use. I also tried to make it as generic and reusable as possible to cover most use cases of hackathon web apps, without being too specific. When I need to use socket.io, I really need it, but most of the time - I don't. But more importantly, WebSockets support is still experimental on most hosting providers. Due to past provider issues with WebSockets, I have not include socket.io as part of the Hackathon Starter. For now... If you need to use socket.io in your app, please continue reading. First, you need to install socket.io: @Code Replace const app  express(); with the following code: @Code I like to have the following code organization in app.js (from top to bottom): module dependencies, import controllers, import configs, connect to database, express configuration, routes, start the server, socket.io stuff. That way I always know where to look for things. Add the following code at the end of app.js: @Code One last thing left to change: @Code to @Code At this point, we are done with the back-end. You now have a choice - to include your JavaScript code in Pug templates or have all your client-side JavaScript in a separate file - in app.js. I admit, when I first started with Node.js and JavaScript in general, I placed all JavaScript code inside templates because I have access to template variables passed in from Express right then and there. It's the easiest thing you can do, but also the least efficient and harder to maintain. Since then I almost never include inline JavaScript inside templates anymore. But it's also understandable if you want to take the easier road. Most of the time you don't even care about performance during hackathons, you just want to 'get shit done' before the time runs out. Well, either way, use whichever approach makes more sense to you. At the end of the day, it's what you build that matters, not how you build it. If you want to stick all your JavaScript inside templates, then in layout.pug - your main template file, add this to head block. @Code Note: Notice the path of the socket.io.js, you don't actually have to have socket.io.js file anywhere in your project; it will be generated automatically at runtime. If you want to have JavaScript code separate from templates, move that inline script code into app.js, inside the $(document).ready() function: @Code And we are done! Cheatsheets -----------"

2651,15308499,4,JavaScript,delayOnTouchOnly option. Whether or not the delay should be applied only if the user is using touch (eg. on a mobile device). No delay will be applied in any other case. Defaults to false. ---
2652,15308499,4,JavaScript,"swapThreshold option. Percentage of the target that the swap zone will take up, as a float between 0 and 1. Read more @link . Demo:  @link ---"
2653,15308499,4,JavaScript,"invertSwap option. Set to true to set the swap zone to the sides of the target, for the effect of sorting 'in between' items. Read more @link . Demo:  @link ---"
2654,15308499,4,JavaScript,"invertedSwapThreshold option. Percentage of the target that the inverted swap zone will take up, as a float between 0 and 1. If not given, will default to swapThreshold. Read more @link . ---"
2655,15308499,4,JavaScript,"direction option. Direction that the Sortable should sort in. Can be set to 'vertical', 'horizontal', or a function, which will be called whenever a target is dragged over. Must return 'vertical' or 'horizontal'. Read more @link . Example of direction detection for vertical list that includes full column and half column elements: @Code ---"
2656,15308499,4,JavaScript,"touchStartThreshold option. This option is similar to fallbackTolerance option. When the delay option is set, some phones with very sensitive touch displays like the Samsung Galaxy S8 will fire unwanted touchmove events even when your finger is not moving, resulting in the sort not triggering. This option sets the minimum pointer movement that must occur before the delayed sorting is cancelled. Values between 3 to 5 are good. ---"
2657,15308499,4,JavaScript,disabled options. Disables the sortable if set to true. Demo:  @link @Code ---
2658,15308499,4,JavaScript,"handle option. To make list items draggable, Sortable disables text selection by the user. That's not always desirable. To allow text selection, define a drag handler, which is an area of every list element that allows it to be dragged around. Demo:  @link @Code @Code @Code ---"

2660,15308499,4,JavaScript,chosenClass option. Class name for the chosen item  (default sortable-chosen). Demo:  @link @Code @Code ---
2661,15308499,4,JavaScript,"forceFallback option. If set to true, the Fallback for non HTML5 Browser will be used, even if we are using an HTML5 Browser. This gives us the possibility to test the behaviour for older Browsers even in newer Browser, or make the Drag 'n Drop feel more consistent between Desktop , Mobile and old Browsers. On top of that, the Fallback always generates a copy of that DOM Element and appends the class fallbackClass defined in the options. This behaviour controls the look of this 'dragged' Element. Demo:  @link ---"
2662,15308499,4,JavaScript,"fallbackTolerance option. Emulates the native drag threshold. Specify in pixels how far the mouse should move before it's considered as a drag. Useful if the items are also clickable like in a list of links. When the user clicks inside a sortable element, it's not uncommon for your hand to move a little between the time you press and the time you release. Dragging only starts if you move the pointer past a certain tolerance, so that you don't accidentally start dragging every time you click. 3 to 5 are probably good values. ---"
2663,15308499,4,JavaScript,"dragoverBubble option. If set to true, the dragover event will bubble to parent sortables. Works on both fallback and native dragover event. By default, it is false, but Sortable will only stop bubbling the event once the element has been inserted into a parent Sortable, or can be inserted into a parent Sortable, but isn't at that specific time (due to animation, etc). Since 1.8.0, you will probably want to leave this option as false. Before 1.8.0, it may need to be true for nested sortables to work. ---"
2664,15308499,4,JavaScript,"removeCloneOnHide option. If set to false, the clone is hidden by having it's CSS display property set to none. By default, this option is true, meaning Sortable will remove the cloned element from the DOM when it is supposed to be hidden. ---"
2665,15308499,4,JavaScript,"emptyInsertThreshold option. The distance (in pixels) the mouse must be from an empty sortable while dragging for the drag element to be inserted into that sortable. Defaults to 5. Set to 0 to disable this feature. Demo:  @link An alternative to this option would be to set a padding on your list when it is empty. For example: @Code Warning: For :empty to work, it must have no node inside (even text one). Demo: @link ---"

You can find such an issue/PR under  @link jQuery has used a different bug tracker - based on Trac - in the past, available under bugs.jquery.com @link . It is being kept in read only mode so that referring to past discussions is possible. When jQuery source references one of those issues, it uses the pattern trac-NUMBER, where NUMBER is the numerical ID of the issue. You can find such an issue under  @link Environments in which to use jQuery -------------------------------------- - Browser support @link - jQuery also supports Node, browser extensions, and other non-browser environments. What you need to build your own jQuery -------------------------------------- To build jQuery, you need to have the latest Node.js/npm and git 1.7 or later. Earlier versions might work, but are not supported. For Windows, you have to download and install git @link  and Node.js @link . macOS users should install Homebrew @link . Once Homebrew is installed, run brew install git to install git, and brew install node to install Node.js. Linux/BSD users should use their appropriate package managers to install git and Node.js, or build from source if you swing that way. Easy-peasy. How to build your own jQuery ---------------------------- First, clone the jQuery git repo @link . Then, enter the jquery directory, install dependencies, and run the build script: @Code The built version of jQuery will be placed in the dist/ directory, along with a minified copy and associated map file."
2738,167174,2,JavaScript,"Build all jQuery release files. To build all variants of jQuery, run the following command: @Code This will create all of the variants that jQuery includes in a release, including jquery.js, jquery.slim.js, jquery.module.js, and jquery.slim.module.js along their associated minified files and sourcemaps. jquery.module.js and jquery.slim.module.js are ECMAScript modules @link  that export jQuery and $ as named exports are placed in the dist-module/ directory rather than the dist/ directory."
2739,167174,2,JavaScript,"Building a Custom jQuery. The build script can be used to create a custom version of jQuery that includes only the modules you need. Any module may be excluded except for core. When excluding selector, it is not removed but replaced with a small wrapper around native querySelectorAll (see below for more information)."
2740,167174,3,JavaScript,"Build Script Help. To see the full list of available options for the build script, run the following: @Code"
2741,167174,3,JavaScript,"Modules. To exclude a module, pass its path relative to the src folder (without the .js extension) to the --exclude option. When using the --include option, the default includes are dropped and a build is created with only those modules. Some example modules that can be excluded or included are: - ajax: All AJAX functionality: $.ajax(), $.get(), $.post(), $.ajaxSetup(), .load(), transports, and ajax event shorthands such as .ajaxStart(). - ajax/xhr: The XMLHTTPRequest AJAX transport only. - ajax/script: The  AJAX transport only; used to retrieve scripts. - ajax/jsonp: The JSONP AJAX transport only; depends on the ajax/script transport. - css: The .css() method. Also removes all modules depending on css (including effects, dimensions, and offset). - css/showHide:  Non-animated .show(), .hide() and .toggle(); can be excluded if you use classes or explicit .css() calls to set the display property. Also removes the effects module. - deprecated: Methods documented as deprecated but not yet removed. - dimensions: The .width() and .height() methods, including inner- and outer- variations. - effects: The .animate() method and its shorthands such as .slideUp() or .hide('slow'). - event: The .on() and .off() methods and all event functionality. - event/trigger: The .trigger() and .triggerHandler() methods. - offset: The .offset(), .position(), .offsetParent(), .scrollLeft(), and .scrollTop() methods. - wrap: The .wrap(), .wrapAll(), .wrapInner(), and .unwrap() methods. - core/ready: Exclude the ready module if you place your scripts at the end of the body. Any ready callbacks bound with jQuery() will simply be called immediately. However, jQuery(document).ready() will not be a function and .on('ready', ...) or similar will not be triggered. - deferred: Exclude jQuery.Deferred. This also excludes all modules that rely on Deferred, including ajax, effects, and queue, but replaces core/ready with core/ready-no-deferred. - exports/global: Exclude the attachment of global jQuery variables ($ and jQuery) to the window. - exports/amd: Exclude the AMD definition. - selector: The full jQuery selector engine. When this module is excluded, it is replaced with a rudimentary selector engine based on the browser's querySelectorAll method that does not support jQuery selector extensions or enhanced semantics. See the selector-native.js @link  file for details. Note: Excluding the full selector module will also exclude all jQuery selector extensions (such as effects/animatedSelector and css/hiddenVisibleSelectors)."
2742,167174,5,JavaScript,"AMD name. You can set the module name for jQuery's AMD definition. By default, it is set to 'jquery', which plays nicely with plugins and third-party libraries, but there may be cases where you'd like to change this. Pass it to the --amd parameter: @Code Or, to define anonymously, leave the name blank. @Code"
2743,167174,5,JavaScript,File name and directory. The default name for the built jQuery file is jquery.js; it is placed under the dist/ directory. It's possible to change the file name using --filename and the directory using --dir. --dir is relative to the project root. @Code This would create a slim version of jQuery and place it under tmp/jquery.slim.js.
2744,167174,5,JavaScript,"ECMAScript Module (ESM) mode. By default, jQuery generates a regular script JavaScript file. You can also generate an ECMAScript module exporting jQuery as the default export using the --esm parameter: @Code"
2745,167174,5,JavaScript,"Factory mode. By default, jQuery depends on a global window. For environments that don't have one, you can generate a factory build that exposes a function accepting window as a parameter that you can provide externally (see README of the published package(build/fixtures/README.md) for usage instructions). You can generate such a factory using the --factory parameter: @Code This option can be mixed with others like --esm or --slim: @Code"
2746,167174,4,JavaScript,"Custom Build Examples. Create a custom build using npm run build, listing the modules to be excluded. Excluding a top-level module also excludes its corresponding directory of modules. Exclude all ajax functionality: @Code Excluding css removes modules depending on CSS: effects, offset, dimensions. @Code Exclude a bunch of modules (-e is an alias for --exclude): @Code There is a special alias to generate a build with the same configuration as the official jQuery Slim build: @Code Or, to create the slim build as an esm module: @Code Non-official custom builds are not regularly tested. Use them at your own risk. Running the Unit Tests -------------------------------------- Make sure you have the necessary dependencies: @Code Start npm start to auto-build jQuery as you work: @Code Run the unit tests with a local server that supports PHP. Ensure that you run the site from the root directory, not the 'test' directory. No database is required. Pre-configured php local servers are available for Windows and Mac. Here are some options: - Windows: WAMP download @link - Mac: MAMP download @link - Linux: Setting up LAMP @link - Mongoose (most platforms) @link Essential Git ------------- As the source code is handled by the Git version control system, it's useful to know some features used."

2748,167174,3,JavaScript,"Rebasing . For feature/topic branches, you should always use the --rebase flag to git pull, or if you are usually handling many temporary 'to be in a github pull request' branches, run the following to automate this: @Code (see man git-config for more information)"
2749,167174,3,JavaScript,"Handling merge conflicts . If you're getting merge conflicts when merging, instead of editing the conflicted files manually, you can use the feature git mergetool. Even though the default tool xxdiff looks awful/old, it's rather useful. The following are some commands that can be used there: Ctrl  Alt  M - automerge as much as possible b - jump to next merge conflict s - change the order of the conflicted lines u - undo a merge left mouse button - mark a block to be the winner middle mouse button - mark a line to be the winner Ctrl  S - save Ctrl  Q - quit QUnit @link  Reference -----------------"
2750,167174,3,JavaScript,Test methods . @Code Note: QUnit's eventual addition of an argument to stop/start is ignored in this test suite so that start and stop can be passed as callbacks without worrying about their parameters.

2755,167174,3,JavaScript,Add random number to url to stop caching . @Code Example: @Code
2756,167174,3,JavaScript,"Run tests in an iframe . Some tests may require a document other than the standard test fixture, and these can be run in a separate iframe. The actual test code and assertions remain in jQuery's main test files; only the minimal test fixture markup and setup code should be placed in the iframe file. @Code This loads a page, constructing a url with fileName './data/'  fileName. The iframed page determines when the callback occurs in the test by including the '/test/data/iframeTest.js' script and calling startIframeTest(  additional args  ) when appropriate. Often this will be after either document ready or window.onload fires. The testCallback receives the QUnit assert object created by testIframe for this test, followed by the global jQuery, window, and document from the iframe. If the iframe code passes any arguments to startIframeTest, they follow the document argument.

The response for a request contains the following information. @Code When using then, you will receive the response as follows: @Code When using catch, or passing a rejection callback @link  as second parameter of then, the response will be available through the error object as explained in the Handling Errors(handling-errors) section.."

Here's an example.. @Code"
2831,23088740,2,JavaScript,"Interceptors. You can intercept requests or responses before they are handled by then or catch. @Code If you need to remove an interceptor later you can. @Code You can also clear all interceptors for requests or responses. @Code You can add interceptors to a custom instance of axios. @Code When you add request interceptors, they are presumed to be asynchronous by default. This can cause a delay in the execution of your axios request when the main thread is blocked (a promise is created under the hood for the interceptor and your request gets put on the bottom of the call stack). If your request interceptors are synchronous you can add a flag to the options object that will tell axios to run the code synchronously and avoid any delays in request execution. @Code If you want to execute a particular interceptor based on a runtime check, you can add a runWhen function to the options object. The interceptor will not be executed if and only if the return of runWhen is false. The function will be called with the config object (don't forget that you can bind your own arguments to it as well.) This can be handy when you have an asynchronous request interceptor that only needs to run at certain times. @Code"
2832,23088740,3,JavaScript,"Multiple Interceptors. Given you add multiple response interceptors and when the response was fulfilled - then each interceptor is executed - then they are executed in the order they were added - then only the last interceptor's result is returned - then every interceptor receives the result of its predecessor - and when the fulfillment-interceptor throws - then the following fulfillment-interceptor is not called - then the following rejection-interceptor is called - once caught, another following fulfill-interceptor is called again (just like in a promise chain). Read the interceptor tests @link  for seeing all this in code."
2833,23088740,2,JavaScript,"Handling Errors. @Code Using the validateStatus config option, you can define HTTP code(s) that should throw an error. @Code js const CancelToken  axios.CancelToken; const source  CancelToken.source(); axios.get('/user/12345', { cancelToken: source.token }).catch(function (thrown) { if (axios.isCancel(thrown)) { console.log('Request canceled', thrown.message); } else { // handle error } }); axios.post('/user/12345', { name: 'new name' }, { cancelToken: source.token }) // cancel the request (the message parameter is optional) source.cancel('Operation canceled by the user.'); @Code js const CancelToken  axios.CancelToken; let cancel; axios.get('/user/12345', { cancelToken: new CancelToken(function executor(c) { // An executor function receives a cancel function as a parameter cancel  c; }) }); // cancel the request cancel(); @Code js const params  new URLSearchParams({ foo: 'bar' }); params.append('extraparam', 'value'); axios.post('/foo', params); @Code js const qs  require('qs'); axios.post('/foo', qs.stringify({ 'bar': 123 })); @Code js import qs from 'qs'; const data  { 'bar': 123 }; const options  { method: 'POST', headers: { 'content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' }, data: qs.stringify(data), url, }; axios(options); @Code js const querystring  require('querystring'); axios.post(' @link querystring.stringify({ foo: 'bar' })); @Code const data  { x: 1, arr: 1, 2, 3, arr2: 1, 2, 3, users: {name: 'Peter', surname: 'Griffin'}, {name: 'Thomas', surname: 'Anderson'}, }; await axios.postForm(' @link data, {headers: {'content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'}} ); @Code js { x: '1', 'arr':  '1', '2', '3' , 'arr20': '1', 'arr210': '2', 'arr22': '3', 'arr3':  '1', '2', '3' , 'users0name': 'Peter', 'users0surname': 'griffin', 'users1name': 'Thomas', 'users1surname': 'Anderson' } @Code js var app  express(); app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true })); // support encoded bodies app.post('/', function (req, res, next) { // echo body as JSON res.send(JSON.stringify(req.body)); }); server  app.listen(3000); @Code js const formData  new FormData(); formData.append('foo', 'bar'); axios.post(' @link formData); @Code js const FormData  require('form-data'); const form  new FormData(); form.append('my_field', 'my value'); form.append('my_buffer', new Buffer(10)); form.append('my_file', fs.createReadStream('/foo/bar.jpg')); axios.post(' @link form) @Code js import axios from 'axios'; axios.post(' @link {x: 1}, { headers: { 'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data' } }).then(({data}) console.log(data)); @Code js const axios require('axios'); var FormData  require('form-data'); axios.post(' @link {x: 1, buf: new Buffer(10)}, { headers: { 'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data' } }).then(({data}) console.log(data)); @Code js const obj  { x: 1, arr: 1, 2, 3, arr2: 1, 2, 3, users: {name: 'Peter', surname: 'Griffin'}, {name: 'Thomas', surname: 'Anderson'}, 'obj2{}': {x:1} }; @Code js const formData new FormData(); formData.append('x', '1'); formData.append('arr', '1'); formData.append('arr', '2'); formData.append('arr', '3'); formData.append('arr20', '1'); formData.append('arr210', '2'); formData.append('arr22', '3'); formData.append('users0name', 'Peter'); formData.append('users0surname', 'Griffin'); formData.append('users1name', 'Thomas'); formData.append('users1surname', 'Anderson'); formData.append('obj2{}', '{'x':1}'); @Code js await axios.postForm(' @link { 'myVar' : 'foo', 'file': document.querySelector('fileInput').files0 . }); @Code js await axios.postForm(' @link { 'files': document.querySelector('fileInput').files . }); @Code js await axios.postForm(' @link document.querySelector('fileInput').files). @Code js await axios.postForm(' @link document.querySelector('htmlForm'));. @Code js await axios.post(' @link document.querySelector('htmlForm'), {. headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }) @Code html Value 1 Value 2 Value 3 @Code js { 'foo': '1', 'deep': { 'prop': { 'spaced': '3' } }, 'baz': '4', '5' , 'user': { 'age': 'value2' } } @Code typescript let user: User  null; try { const { data }  await axios.get('/user?ID12345'); user  data.userDetails; } catch (error) { if (axios.isAxiosError(error)) { handleAxiosError(error); } else { handleUnexpectedError(error); } }"

Traditionally this is the file that you'll link to in a browser. In fact both the demo and test files do exactly that. css/(css/): Contains a CSS file used by the demo. This file is not required for using impress.js in your own presentations. Impress.js creates the CSS it needs dynamically. extras/(extras/) contains plugins that for various reasons aren't enabled by default. You have to explicitly add them with their own script element to use them. build.js(build.js): Simple build file that creates js/impress.js. It also creates a minified version impress.min.js, but that one is not included in the github repository. package.json(build.js): An NPM package specification. This was mainly added so you can easily install buildify @link  and run node build.js. Other than the build process, which is really just doing roughly cat src/impress.js src/plugins//.js  js/impress.js, and testing, impress.js itself doesn't depend on Node or any NPM modules. WANT TO CONTRIBUTE? --------------------- For developers, once you've made changes to the code, you should run these commands for testing: npm install npm run all Note that running firefox qunit_test_runner.html is usually more informative than running karma with npm run test. They both run the same tests. More info about the src/(src/) directory can be found in src/plugins/README.md(src/plugins/README.md)."

It's an (un)fortunate coincidence that an Open/LibreOffice presentation tool is called Impress ;) Reference API -------------- See the Reference API(DOCUMENTATION.md) BROWSER SUPPORT ----------------- The design goal for impress.js has been to showcase awesome CSS3 features as found in modern browser versions. We also use some new DOM functionality, and specifically do not use jQuery or any other JavaScript libraries, nor our own functions, to support older browsers. In general, recent versions of Firefox and Chrome are known to work well. Reportedly IE now works too. The typical use case for impress.js is to create presentations that you present from your own laptop, with a browser version you know works well. Some people also use impress.js successfully to embed animations or presentations in a web page, however, be aware that in this some of your visitors may not see the presentation correctly, or at all. In particular, impress.js makes use of the following JS and CSS features: DataSet API @link . ClassList API @link . CSS 3D Transforms @link . CSS Transitions @link .

2904,31085130,2,JavaScript,How it works. Here's @link  a video tutorial explaining how to export a basic animation and load it in an html page
2905,31085130,3,JavaScript,"After Effects. - Open your AE project and select the bodymovin extension on Window  Extensions  bodymovin - A Panel will open with a Compositions tab listing all of your Project Compositions. - Select the composition you want to export. - Select a Destination Folder. - Click Render - look for the exported json file (if you had images or AI layers on your animation, there will be an images folder with the exported files)"
2906,31085130,3,JavaScript,"HTML. - get the lottie.js file from the build/player/ folder for the latest build - include the .js file on your html (remember to gzip it for production) @Code You can call lottie.loadAnimation() to start an animation. It takes an object as a unique param with: - animationData: an Object with the exported animation data. Note: If your animation contains repeaters and you plan to call loadAnimation multiple times with the same animation, please deep clone the object before passing it (see 1159 @link  and 2151 @link .). - path: the relative path to the animation object. (animationData and path are mutually exclusive) - loop: true / false / number - autoplay: true / false it will start playing as soon as it is ready - name: animation name for future reference - renderer: 'svg' / 'canvas' / 'html' to set the renderer - container: the dom element on which to render the animation It returns the animation instance you can control with play, pause, setSpeed, etc. @Code"
2907,31085130,4,JavaScript,Composition Settings:. Check this wiki page for an explanation for each setting. @link
2908,31085130,2,JavaScript,Usage. Animation instances have these main methods:
2909,31085130,3,JavaScript,setSpeed(speed). - speed: 1 is normal speed.
2910,31085130,3,JavaScript,"goToAndStop(value, isFrame). - value: numeric value. - isFrame: defines if first argument is a time based value or a frame based (default false)."
2911,31085130,3,JavaScript,"goToAndPlay(value, isFrame). - value: numeric value. - isFrame: defines if first argument is a time based value or a frame based (default false)."
2912,31085130,3,JavaScript,"setDirection(direction). - direction: 1 is forward, -1 is reverse."
2913,31085130,3,JavaScript,"playSegments(segments, forceFlag). - segments: array. Can contain 2 numeric values that will be used as first and last frame of the animation. Or can contain a sequence of arrays each with 2 numeric values. - forceFlag: boolean. If set to false, it will wait until the current segment is complete. If true, it will update values immediately."
2914,31085130,3,JavaScript,"setSubframe(useSubFrames). - useSubFrames:  If false, it will respect the original AE fps. If true, it will update on every requestAnimationFrame with intermediate values. Default is true."
2915,31085130,3,JavaScript,"getDuration(inFrames). - inFrames:  If true, returns duration in frames, if false, in seconds."
2916,31085130,3,JavaScript,Additional methods:. - updateDocumentData -- updates a text layer's data More Info @link
2917,31085130,3,JavaScript,"Lottie has several global methods that will affect all animations:. lottie.play() -- with 1 optional parameter name to target a specific animation lottie.stop() -- with 1 optional parameter name to target a specific animation lottie.goToAndStop(value, isFrame, name) -- Moves an animation with the specified name playback to the defined time. If name is omitted, moves all animation instances. lottie.setSpeed() -- first argument speed (1 is normal speed) -- with 1 optional parameter name to target a specific animation lottie.setDirection() -- first argument direction (1 is normal direction.) -- with 1 optional parameter name to target a specific animation lottie.searchAnimations() -- looks for elements with class 'lottie' or 'bodymovin' lottie.loadAnimation() -- Explained above. returns an animation instance to control individually. lottie.destroy(name) -- Destroys an animation with the specified name. If name is omitted, destroys all animation instances. The DOM element will be emptied. lottie.registerAnimation() -- you can register an element directly with registerAnimation. It must have the 'data-animation-path' attribute pointing at the data.json url lottie.getRegisteredAnimations() -- returns all animations instances lottie.setQuality() -- default 'high', set 'high','medium','low', or a number  1 to improve player performance. In some animations as low as 2 won't show any difference. lottie.setLocationHref() -- Sets the relative location from where svg elements with ids are referenced. It's useful when you experience mask issues in Safari. lottie.freeze() -- Freezes all playing animations or animations that will be loaded lottie.unfreeze() -- Unfreezes all animations lottie.inBrowser() -- true if the library is being run in a browser lottie.resize() -- Resizes all animation instances"
2918,31085130,2,JavaScript,Events. - onComplete - onLoopComplete - onEnterFrame - onSegmentStart you can also use addEventListener with the following events: - complete - loopComplete - drawnFrame - enterFrame - segmentStart - config_ready (when initial config is done) - data_ready (when all parts of the animation have been loaded) - data_failed (when part of the animation can not be loaded) - loaded_images (when all image loads have either succeeded or errored) - DOMLoaded (when elements have been added to the DOM) - destroy
2919,31085130,4,JavaScript,"Other loading options. - if you want to use an existing canvas to draw, you can pass an extra object: 'rendererSettings' with the following configuration: @Code Doing this you will have to handle the canvas clearing after each frame Another way to load animations is adding specific attributes to a dom element. You have to include a div and set it's class to 'lottie'. If you do it before page load, it will automatically search for all tags with the class 'lottie'. Or you can call lottie.searchAnimations() after page load and it will search all elements with the class 'lottie'. - Add the data.json to a folder relative to the html - Create a div that will contain the animation. - Required - A class called 'lottie' - A 'data-animation-path' attribute with relative path to the data.json - Optional - A 'data-anim-loop' attribute - A 'data-name' attribute to specify a name to target play controls specifically Example @Code"
2920,31085130,2,JavaScript,"Preview. You can preview or take an svg snapshot of the animation to use as poster. After you render your animation, you can take a snapshot of any frame in the animation and save it to your disk. I recommend to pass the svg through an svg optimizer like  @link and play around with their settings."
2921,31085130,3,JavaScript,"Files. If you have any images or AI layers that you haven't converted to shapes (I recommend that you convert them, so they get exported as vectors, right click each layer and do: 'Create shapes from Vector Layers'), they will be saved to an images folder relative to the destination json folder. Beware not to overwrite an existing folder on that same location."
2922,31085130,3,JavaScript,"Performance. This is real time rendering. Although it is pretty optimized, it always helps if you keep your AE project to what is necessary More optimizations are on their way, but try not to use huge shapes in AE only to mask a small part of it. Too many nodes will also affect performance."
2923,31085130,3,JavaScript,"Help. If you have any animations that don't work or want me to export them, don't hesitate to write. I'm really interested in seeing what kind of problems the plugin has. my email is hernantorrisi@gmail.com"
2924,31085130,2,JavaScript,"AE Feature Support. - The script supports precomps, shapes, solids, images, null objects, texts - It supports masks and inverted masks. Maybe other modes will come but it has a huge performance hit. - It supports time remapping - The script supports shapes, rectangles, ellipses and stars. - Expressions. Check the wiki page for more info. @link - Not supported: image sequences, videos and audio are not supported - No  negative layer stretching! No idea why, but stretching a layer messes with all the data."
2925,31085130,2,JavaScript,Development. npm install or bower install first npm start
2926,31085130,2,JavaScript,"Notes. - If you want to modify the parser or the player, there are some gulp commands that can simplify the task - look at the great animations exported on codepen See examples on codepen. @link - gzipping the animation jsons and the player have a huge reduction on the filesize. I recommend doing it if you use it for a project."
2927,31085130,2,JavaScript,"Issues. - For missing mask in Safari browser, please call lottie.setLocationHref(locationHref) before animation is generated. It usually caused by usage of base tag in html. (see above for description of setLocationHref)"

Our curriculum is designed with two key pedagogical principles in mind: project-based learning frequent quizzes The program teaches the fundamentals of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, as well as the latest tools and techniques used by today's web developers. Students will have the opportunity to develop hands-on experience by building a typing game, virtual terrarium, eco-friendly browser extension, space-invader-style game, and a banking app for businesses. By the end of the series, students will have gained a solid understanding of web development. You can take the first few lessons in this curriculum as a Learn Path @link  on Microsoft Learn! By ensuring that the content aligns with projects, the process is made more engaging for students and retention of concepts will be augmented. We also wrote several starter lessons in JavaScript basics to introduce concepts, paired with a video from the 'Beginners Series to: JavaScript @link ' collection of video tutorials, some of whose authors contributed to this curriculum. In addition, a low-stakes quiz before a class sets the intention of the student towards learning a topic, while a second quiz after class ensures further retention. This curriculum was designed to be flexible and fun and can be taken in whole or in part. The projects start small and become increasingly complex by the end of the 12-week cycle. While we have purposefully avoided introducing JavaScript frameworks to concentrate on the basic skills needed as a web developer before adopting a framework, a good next step to completing this curriculum would be learning about Node.js via another collection of videos: 'Beginner Series to: Node.js @link '.

2971,34302698,1,JavaScript,"Serverless Framework - V.4. June 12th, 2024 – We've released Serverless Framework V.4 GA after testing the V.4 Alpha and Beta since early 2024. If you are upgrading to V.4, see our Upgrading to Serverless Framework V4 Documentation @link . If you need to access documentation for Serverless Framework V.3, you can find it here @link ."
2972,34302698,2,JavaScript,"New Features In V.4. Here's a list of everything that's new in V.4, so far: - Native Typescript Support: You can now use .ts handlers in your AWS Lambda functions in serverless.yml and have them build automatically upon deploy. ESBuild @link  is now included in the Framework which makes this possible. More info here @link . - New Dev Mode: Run serverless dev to have events from your live architecture routed to your local code, enabling you to make fast changes without deployment. More info here @link . - New Stages Property: Easily organize stage-specific config via stages and set default config to fallback to. - New Terraform & Vault Integrations: Pull state outputs from several Terraform state storage solutions, and secrets from Vault. Terraform Docs @link  Vault Docs @link - Support Command: Send support requests to our team directly from the CLI @link , which auto-include contextual info which you can review before sending. - Debug Summary for AI: When you run into a bug, you can run 'serverless support --ai' to generate a concise report detailing your last bug with all necessary context, optimized for pasting into AI tools such as ChatGPT. - New AWS Lambda Runtimes: 'python3.12', 'dotnet8', and 'java21'. - Advanced Logging Controls for AWS Lambda: Capture Logs in JSON, increased log granularity, and setting a custom Log Group. Here is the AWS article @link . Here is the YAML implementation @link . - AWS SSO: Environment variables, especially ones set by AWS SSO, are prioritized. The Framework and Dashboard no longer interfere with these. - Automatic Updates: These happen by default now. Though, you will be able to control the level of updates you're open to. - Improved Onboarding & Set-Up: The serverless command has been re-written to be more helpful when setting up a new or existing project. - Updated Custom Resource Handlers: All custom resource handlers now use nodejs20.x. - Deprecation Of Non-AWS Providers: Deprecation of other cloud providers, in favor of handling this better in our upcoming Serverless Framework 'Extensions'."
2973,34302698,2,JavaScript,"Breaking Changes. We're seeking to avoid breaking changes for the 'aws' Provider. However, there are a few large things that are changing to be aware of: - The V.4 License is changing. See the section below for more information on this. - Authentication is required within the CLI. - Non-AWS Providers have been deprecated. We will be introducing new ways in V.4 to use other cloud infrastructure vendors. If you stumble upon additional breaking changes, please create an issue. To learn more about what's different and potential breaking changes, please see our Upgrading to Serverless Framework V4 Documentation @link ."
2974,34302698,2,JavaScript,"License Changes in V.4. Please note, the structure and licensing of the V.4 repository differ from the V.4 npm module. The npm module contains some proprietary licensed software, as V.4 transitions to a common SaaS product, as previously announced @link . The original Serverless Framework source code and more will continue to remain MIT license software, the repository will soon be restructured to clearly distinguish between proprietary and open-source components."

2977,34302698,1,JavaScript,"Quick Start. Here's how to install the Serverless Framework, set up a project and deploy it to Amazon Web Services on serverless infrastructure like AWS Lambda, AWS DynamoDB, AWS S3 and more."
2978,34302698,2,JavaScript,"Install the Serverless Framework via NPM. First, you must have the Node.js runtime @link  installed, version 18.20.3 or greater, then you can install the Serverless Framework via NPM. Open your CLI and run the command below to install the Serverless Framework globally. @Code Run serverless to verify your installation is working, and show the current version."
2979,34302698,2,JavaScript,"Update Serverless Framework. As of version 4, the Serverless Framework automatically updates itself and performs a check to do so every 24 hours. You can force an update by running this command: @Code Or, you can set this environment variable: @Code"
2980,34302698,2,JavaScript,"The serverless Command. The Serverless Framework ships with a serverless command that walks you through getting a project created and deployed onto AWS. It helps with downloading a Template, setting up AWS Credentials, setting up the Serverless Framework Dashboard, and more, while explaining each concept along the way. This guide will also walk you through getting started with the Serverless Framework, but please note, simply typing the serverless command may be the superior experience. @Code"
2981,34302698,2,JavaScript,"Create A Service. The primary concept for a project in the Serverless Framework is known as a 'Service', and its declared by a serverless.yml file, which contains simplified syntax for deploying cloud infrastructure, such as AWS Lambda functions, infrastructure that triggers those functions with events, and additional infrastructure your AWS Lambda functions may need for various use-cases (e.g. AWS DynamoDB database tables, AWS S3 storage buckets, AWS API Gateways for recieving HTTP requests and forwarding them to AWS Lambda). A Service can either be an entire application, logic for a specific domain (e.g. 'blog', 'users', 'products'), or a microservice handling one task. You decide how to organize your project. Generally, we recommend starting with a monolithic approach to everything to reduce complexity, until breaking up logic is absolutely necessary. To create and fully set up a Serverless Framework Service, use the serverless command, which offers an interactive set-up workflow. @Code This will show you several Templates. Choose one that fits the language and use-case you want. @Code After selecting a Service Template, its files will be downloaded and you will have the opportunity to give your Service a name. @Code Please use only lowercase letters, numbers and hyphens. Also, keep Service names short, since they are added into the name of each cloud resource the Serverless Framework creates, and some cloud resources have character length restrictions in their names. Learn more about Services and more in the Core Concepts documentation @link ."
2982,34302698,2,JavaScript,"Signing In. As of Serverless Framework V.4, if you are using the serverless command to set up a Service, it will eventually ask you to log in. If you need to log in outside of that, run serverless login. Logging in will redirect you to the Serverless Framework Dashboard @link  within your browser. After registering or logging in, go back to your CLI and you will be signed in. Please note, you can get up and running with the Serverless Framework CLI and Dashboard for free, and the CLI will always be free for small orgs and indiehackers. For more information on pricing, check out our pricing page @link ."
2983,34302698,2,JavaScript,"Creating An App. The 'App' concept is a parent container for one or many 'Services' which you can optionally set via the app property in your serverless.yml. Setting an app also enables Serverless Framework Dashboard features for that Service, like tracking your Services and their deployments in Serverless Framework Dashboard, enabling sharing outputs between them, sharing secrets between them, and enabling metrics, traces and logs. If you are using the serverless onboarding command, it will help you set up an app and add it to your Service. You can use the serverless command to create an App on an existing Service as well, or create an App in the Dashboard. @Code The app can also be set manually in serverless.yml via the app property: @Code If you don't want to use the Serverless Framework Dashboard's features, simply don't add an app property. Apps are not required."
2984,34302698,2,JavaScript,"Setting Up AWS Credentials. To deploy cloud infrastructure to AWS, you must give the Serverless Framework access to your AWS credentials. Running the Serverless Framework's serverless command in a new or existing Service will help identify if AWS credentials have been set correctly or if they are expired, or help you set them up from scratch. @Code We recommend creating an AWS IAM Role that's stored in the Serverless Framework Dashboard. We'll be supporting a lot of Provider Credentials in the near future, and the Dashboard is a great place to keep these centralized across your team, helping you stay organized, and securely eliminating the need to keep credentials on the machines of your teammates. If you are using AWS SSO, we recommend simply pasting your temporary SSO credentials within the terminal as environment variables. To learn more about setting up your AWS Credentials, read this guide @link ."
2985,34302698,2,JavaScript,"Deploy A Service. After you've used the serverless command to set up everything, it's time to deploy your Service to AWS. Make sure your terminal session is within the directory that contains your serverless.yml file. If you just created a Service, don't forget to cd into it. @Code Deploying will create/update cloud infrastructure and code on AWS, all at the same time. Run the deploy command: @Code More details on deploying can be found here @link ."
2986,34302698,2,JavaScript,"Developing. Many Serverless Framework and serverless developers generally choose to develop on the cloud, since it matches reality (i.e. your production environment), and emulating Lambda and other infrastructure dependencies locally can be complex. In Serverless Framework V.4, we've created a _hybrid approach to development_, to help developers develop rapidly with the accuracy of the real cloud environment. This is the new dev command: @Code When you run this command, the following happens... An AWS Cloudformation deployment will happen to slightly modify all of the AWS Lambda functions within your Service so that they include a lightweight wrapper. Once this AWS Cloudformation deployment has completed, your live AWS Lambda functions within your Service will still be able to receive events and be invoked within AWS. However, the events will be securely and instantly proxied down to your machine, and the code on your machine which will be run, rather than the code within your live AWS Lambda functions. This allows you to make changes to your code, without having to deploy or recreate every aspect of your architecture locally, allowing you to develop rapidly. Logs from your local code will also be shown within your terminal dev session. Once your code has finished, the response from your local code will be forwarded back up to your live AWS Lambda functions, and they will return the response—just like a normal AWS Lambda function in the cloud would. Please note, dev is only designed for development or personal stages/environments and should not be run in production or any stage where a high volume of events are being processed. Once you are finished with your dev session, you MUST re-deploy, using serverless deploy to push your recent local changes back to your live AWS Lambda functions—or your AWS Lambda functions will fail(!) More details on dev mode can be found here @link ."
2987,34302698,2,JavaScript,"Invoking. To invoke your AWS Lambda function on the cloud, you can find URLs for your functions w/ API endpoints in the serverless deploy output, or retrieve them via serverless info. If your functions do not have API endpoints, you can use the invoke command, like this: @Code More details on the invoke command can be found here @link ."
2988,34302698,2,JavaScript,"Deploy Functions. To deploy code changes quickly, you can skip the serverless deploy command which is much slower since it triggers a full AWS CloudFormation update, and deploy only code and configuration changes to a specific AWS Lambda function. To deploy code and configuration changes to individual AWS Lambda functions in seconds, use the deploy function command, with -f function name in serverless.yml set to the function you want to deploy. @Code More details on the deploy function command can be found here @link ."
2989,34302698,2,JavaScript,Streaming Logs. You can use Serverless Framework to stream logs from AWS Cloudwatch directly to your terminal. Use the sls logs command in a separate terminal window: @Code Target a specific function via the -f option and enable tailing (i.e. streaming) via the -t option.
2990,34302698,2,JavaScript,"Full Local Development. Many Serverless Framework users choose to emulate their entire serverless architecture locally. Please note, emulating AWS Lambda and other cloud services is never accurate and the process can be complex, especially as your project and teammates grow. As of V.4, we highly recommend using the new dev mode with personal stages. If you do choose to develop locally, we recommend the following workflow... Use the invoke local command to invoke your function locally: @Code You can also pass data to this local invocation via a variety of ways. Here's one of them: @Code More details on the invoke local command can be found here @link Serverless Framework also has a great plugin that allows you to run a server locally and emulate AWS API Gateway. This is the serverless-offline command. More details on the serverless-offline plugins command can be found here @link ."
2991,34302698,2,JavaScript,"Use Plugins. A big benefit of Serverless Framework is within its Plugin ecosystem @link . Plugins extend or overwrite the Serverless Framework, giving it new use-cases or capabilites, and there are hundreds of them. Some of the most common Plugins are: - Serverless Offline @link  - Emulate AWS Lambda and API Gateway locally when developing your Serverless project. - Serverless Domain Manager @link  - Manage custom domains with AWS API Gateways. - Serverless Step Functions @link  - Build AWS Step Functions architectures. - Serverless Python Requirements @link  - Bundle dependencies from requirements.txt and make them available in your PYTHONPATH."
2992,34302698,2,JavaScript,"Remove Your Service. If you want to delete your service, run remove. This will delete all the AWS resources created by your project and ensure that you don't incur any unexpected charges. It will also remove the service from Serverless Dashboard. @Code More details on the remove command can be found here @link ."
2993,34302698,2,JavaScript,"Composing Services. Serverless Framework Compose allows you to work with multiple Serverless Framework Services at once, and do the following... - Deploy multiple services in parallel - Deploy services in a specific order - Share outputs from one service to another - Run commands across multiple services Here is what a project structure might look like: @Code Using Serverless Framework Compose requires a serverless-compose.yml file. In it, you specify which Services you wish to deploy. You can also share data from one Service to another, which also creates a deployment order. @Code Currently, outputs to be inherited by another Service must be AWS Cloudformation Outputs. @Code The value will be passed to service-b as a parameter @link  named queueUrl. Parameters can be referenced in Serverless Framework configuration via the ${param:xxx} syntax: @Code More details on Serverless Framework Compose can be found here @link ."
2994,34302698,2,JavaScript,"Support Command. In Serverless Framework V.4, we've introduced the serverless support command, a standout feature that lets you generate issue reports, or directly connect with our support team. It automatically includes relevant context and omits sensitive details like secrets and account information, which you can check before submission. This streamlined process ensures your issues are quickly and securely addressed. To use this feature, after an error or any command, run: @Code After each command, whether it succeeded or not, the context is saved within your current working directory in the .serverless folder. To open a new support ticket, run the sls support command and select Get priority support.... Optionally you'll be able to review and edit the generated report. Opening support tickets is only available to users who sign up for a Subscription. You can also generate reports without submitting a new support ticket. This is useful for sharing context with others, opening Github issues, or using it with an AI prompt like ChatGPT. To do this, run the sls support command and select Create a summary report..., or Create a comprehensive report... You can skip the prompt by running sls support --summary or sls support --all. This is especially useful for capturing the report into the clipboard (e.g. sls support --summary"

Install Install with npm: @Code Install with yarn: @Code Introduction Webpack is a bundler for modules. The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset. TL;DR - Bundles ES Modules @link , CommonJS @link , and AMD @link  modules (even combined). - Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time). - Dependencies are resolved during compilation, reducing the runtime size. - Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.g. TypeScript to JavaScript, Handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc. - Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires."

3024,3678731,3,JavaScript,"Browser Compatibility. Webpack supports all browsers that are ES5-compliant @link  (IE8 and below are not supported). Webpack also needs Promise for import() and require.ensure(). If you want to support older browsers, you will need to load a polyfill @link  before using these expressions. Concepts"
3025,3678731,3,JavaScript,Plugins @link . Webpack has a rich plugin interface @link . Most of the features within webpack itself use this plugin interface. This makes webpack very flexible. common-npm:  @link mini-css:  @link mini-css-npm:  @link mini-css-size:  @link component:  @link component-npm:  @link component-size:  @link compression:  @link compression-npm:  @link compression-size:  @link html-plugin:  @link html-plugin-npm:  @link html-plugin-size:  @link pug-plugin:  @link pug-plugin-npm:  @link pug-plugin-size:  @link
3026,3678731,3,JavaScript,"Loaders @link . Webpack enables the use of loaders to preprocess files. This allows you to bundle any static resource way beyond JavaScript. You can easily write your own loaders @link  using Node.js. Loaders are activated by using loadername! prefixes in require() statements, or are automatically applied via regex from your webpack configuration."

3033,3678731,3,JavaScript,Performance. Webpack uses async I/O and has multiple caching levels. This makes webpack fast and incredibly fast on incremental compilations.
3034,3678731,3,JavaScript,"Module Formats. Webpack supports ES2015, CommonJS and AMD modules out of the box. It performs clever static analysis on the AST of your code. It even has an evaluation engine to evaluate simple expressions. This allows you to support most existing libraries out of the box."
3035,3678731,3,JavaScript,Code Splitting @link . Webpack allows you to split your codebase into multiple chunks. Chunks are loaded asynchronously at runtime. This reduces the initial loading time.
3036,3678731,3,JavaScript,"Optimizations @link . Webpack can do many optimizations to reduce the output size of your JavaScript by deduplicating frequently used modules, minifying, and giving you full control of what is loaded initially and what is loaded at runtime through code splitting. It can also make your code chunks cache friendly by using hashes. Contributing We want contributing to webpack to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone, and everyone. We have a vibrant ecosystem @link  that spans beyond this single repo. We welcome you to check out any of the repositories in our organization @link  or webpack-contrib organization @link  which houses all of our loaders and plugins. Contributions go far beyond pull requests and commits. Although we love giving you the opportunity to put your stamp on webpack, we also are thrilled to receive a variety of other contributions including: - Documentation @link  updates, enhancements, designs, or bugfixes - Spelling or grammar fixes - README.md corrections or redesigns - Adding unit, or functional tests - Triaging GitHub issues -- especially determining whether an issue still persists or is reproducible. - Searching webpack on twitter @link  and helping someone else who needs help. - Teaching others how to contribute to one of the many webpack's repos! - Blogging, speaking about, or creating tutorials @link  about one of webpack's many features. - Helping others in our webpack gitter channel @link . To get started have a look at our documentation on contributing @link . If you are worried or don't know where to start, you can always reach out to Sean Larkin (@TheLarkInn) on Twitter @link  or simply submit an issue and a maintainer can help give you guidance! We have also started a series on our Medium Publication @link  called The Contributor's Guide to webpack @link . We welcome you to read it and post any questions or responses if you still need help. _Looking to speak about webpack?_ We'd love to review your talk abstract/CFP!

Because of its flexibility, webpack isn't always the _easiest_ entry-level solution, however we do believe it is the most powerful. That said, we're always looking for ways to improve and simplify the tool without compromising functionality. If you have any ideas on ways to accomplish this, we're all ears! If you're just getting started, take a look at our new docs and concepts page @link . This has a high level overview that is great for beginners!! Looking for webpack 1 docs? Please check out the old wiki @link , but note that this deprecated version is no longer supported. If you want to discuss something or just need help, here is our Gitter room @link  where there are always individuals looking to help out! If you are still having difficulty, we would love for you to post a question to StackOverflow with the webpack tag @link . It is much easier to answer questions that include your webpack.config.js and relevant files! So if you can provide them, we'd be extremely grateful (and more likely to help you find the answer!) If you are twitter savvy you can tweet webpack with your question and someone should be able to reach out and help also..

It is intended to be used in mobile websites, mobile web apps, and mobile native/hybrid apps. Swiper is not compatible with all platforms, it is a modern touch slider which is focused only on modern apps/platforms to bring the best experience and simplicity."
3039,3721224,2,JavaScript,"Features. - Tree-shakeable: Only modules you use will be imported into your app's bundle. - Mobile-friendly: It is intended to be used in mobile websites, mobile web apps, and mobile native/hybrid apps. - Library Agnostic: Swiper doesn't require any JavaScript libraries like jQuery, which makes Swiper much smaller and faster. It can be safely used with libraries such as jQuery, Zepto, jQuery Mobile, etc. - 1:1 Touch movement: By default, Swiper provides 1:1 touch movement interaction, but this ratio can be configured through Swiper settings. - Mutation Observer: Swiper has an option to enable Mutation Observer, with this feature Swiper will be automatically reinitialized and recalculate all required parameters if you make dynamic changes to the DOM, or in Swiper styles itself. - Rich API: Swiper comes with a very rich API. It allows creating your own pagination, navigation buttons, parallax effects and many more. - RTL: Swiper is the only slider that provides 100% RTL support with correct layout. - Multi Row Slides Layout: Swiper allows a multiple row slides layout, with a few slides per column. - Transition Effects: Fade, Flip, 3D Cube, 3D Coverflow. - Two-way Control: Swiper may be used as controller for any number of other Swipers, and even be controlled at the same time. - Full Navigation Control: Swiper comes with all required built-in navigation elements, such as Pagination, Navigation arrows and Scrollbar. - Flexbox Layout: Swiper uses modern flexbox layout for slides layout, which solves a lot of problems and time with size caclulations. Such layout also allows configuring the Slides grid using pure CSS. - Most Flexible Slides Layout Grid: Swiper has a lot of parameters on initialization to make it as flexible as possible. You can control slides per view, per column, per group, space between slides, and many more. - Images Lazy Loading: Swiper Lazy Loading delays loading of images in inactive/invisible slides until the user swipes to them. Such feature could make the page load faster and improve Swiper performance. - Virtual Slides: Swiper comes with Virtual Slides feature that is great when you have a lot of slides or content-heavy/image-heavy slides so it will keep just the required amount of slides in DOM. - Loop mode - Autoplay - Keyboard control - Mousewheel control - Nested sliders - History navigation - Hash navigation - Breakpoints configuration - Accessibility (A11y) - And many more ..."

For AMD or script-tag loading. - polyfills\.js: Required polyfills for older browsers like Internet Explorer. The es variant simply imports all required polyfills from core-js, the umd variant is self-contained. Usually it is not necessary to specify the exact file in the import statement. Build tools or Node automatically figure out the right file, so importing 'jspdf' is enough."

3088,402046,3,JavaScript,"Optional dependencies. Some functions of jsPDF require optional dependencies. E.g. the html method, which depends on html2canvas and, when supplied with a string HTML document, dompurify. JsPDF loads them dynamically when required (using the respective module format, e.g. dynamic imports). Build tools like Webpack will automatically create separate chunks for each of the optional dependencies. If your application does not use any of the optional dependencies, you can prevent Webpack from generating the chunks by defining them as external dependencies: @Code In Vue CLI projects, externals can be defined via the configureWebpack @link . or chainWebpack @link  properties of the vue.config.js file. (needs to be created, first, in fresh projects). In Angular projects, externals can be defined using custom webpack builders @link . In React (create-react-app) projects, externals can be defined by either using react-app-rewired @link  or ejecting."

3091,402046,2,JavaScript,"Use of Unicode Characters / UTF-8:. The 14 standard fonts in PDF are limited to the ASCII-codepage. If you want to use UTF-8 you have to integrate a custom font, which provides the needed glyphs. jsPDF supports .ttf-files. So if you want to have for example Chinese text in your pdf, your font has to have the necessary Chinese glyphs. So, check if your font supports the wanted glyphs or else it will show garbled characters instead of the right text. To add the font to jsPDF use our fontconverter in /fontconverter/fontconverter.html @link . The fontconverter will create a js-file with the content of the provided ttf-file as base64 encoded string and additional code for jsPDF. You just have to add this generated js-File to your project. You are then ready to go to use setFont-method in your code and write your UTF-8 encoded text. Alternatively you can just load the content of the \.ttf file as a binary string using fetch or XMLHttpRequest and add the font to the PDF file: @Code"
3092,402046,2,JavaScript,"Advanced Functionality. Since the merge with the yWorks fork @link  there are a lot of new features. However, some of them are API breaking, which is why there is an API-switch between two API modes: - In 'compat' API mode, jsPDF has the same API as MrRio's original version, which means full compatibility with plugins. However, some advanced features like transformation matrices and patterns won't work. This is the default mode. - In 'advanced' API mode, jsPDF has the API you're used from the yWorks-fork version. This means the availability of all advanced features like patterns, FormObjects, and transformation matrices. You can switch between the two modes by calling @Code JsPDF will automatically switch back to the original API mode after the callback has run."

3099,42283287,4,JavaScript,"Tutorial: Building UI with Preact. With Preact, you create user interfaces by assembling trees of components and elements. Components are functions or classes that return a description of what their tree should output. These descriptions are typically written in JSX @link  (shown underneath), or HTM @link  which leverages standard JavaScript Tagged Templates. Both syntaxes can express trees of elements with 'props' (similar to HTML attributes) and children. To get started using Preact, first look at the render() function. This function accepts a tree description and creates the structure described. Next, it appends this structure to a parent DOM element provided as the second argument. Future calls to render() will reuse the existing tree and update it in-place in the DOM. Internally, render() will calculate the difference from previous outputted structures in an attempt to perform as few DOM operations as possible. @Code Hooray! render() has taken our structure and output a User Interface! This approach demonstrates a simple case, but would be difficult to use as an application grows in complexity. Each change would be forced to calculate the difference between the current and updated structure for the entire application. Components can help here – by dividing the User Interface into nested Components each can calculate their difference from their mounted point. Here's an example: @Code ---"

Note that any changes you make to the pretty HTML will be lost when you revert to Markdown. In Gmail, you can also use the browser's Undo command (CTRLZ / CMDZ, or from the Edit menu). Be warned that you might also lose the last few characters you entered."
3114,4311796,3,JavaScript,"Replies. In Gmail, Thunderbird, and Google Groups, you can use 'Markdown Toggle' normally: just write your reply (top, bottom, inline, wherever) and then convert. The original email that you're replying to will be left alone. (Technically: Existing blockquote blocks will be left intact.) In Hotmail and Yahoo (which don't put the original in a blockquote), and optionally in Gmail, Thunderbird, and Google Groups, you can ensure that only the part of the reply that you wrote gets converted by selecting what you want to convert and then clicking 'Markdown Toggle' -- see the next section."
3115,4311796,3,JavaScript,"Selection/Piecemeal Conversion. Sometimes you don't want to convert the entire email; sometimes your email isn't entirely Markdown. To convert only part of the email, select the text (with your mouse or keyboard), right-click on it, and click the 'Markdown Toggle' menu item. Your selection is magically rendered into pretty HTML. To revert back to Markdown, just put your cursor anywhere in the block of converted text, right click, and click the 'Markdown Toggle' menu item again. Now it's magically back to the original Markdown."
3116,4311796,4,JavaScript,"Things to know about converting/reverting a selection. If you select only part of a block of text, only that text will be converted. The converted block will be wrapped in a paragraph element, so the original line will be broken up. You probably don't want to ever do this. You can select and revert multiple converted blocks at the same time. One upshot of this is that you can select your entire email, click 'Markdown Toggle', and all portions of it that you had converted will be reverted. If you don't have anything selected when you click 'Markdown Toggle', Markdown Here will check if there are converted blocks anywhere in the message and revert them. If there no converted blocks are found, it will convert the entire email."

3120,4311796,2,JavaScript,"Notes and Miscellaneous. Markdown Here uses Github Flavored Markdown @link , with the limitation that GFM special links are not supported (issue 11 @link ); nor will they be, as MDH is not Github-specific.. Available languages for syntax highlighting (and the way they should be written in the fenced code block) can be seen on the highlight.js demo page @link . Images embedded inline in your Markdown will be retained when you 'Markdown Toggle'. Gmail allows you to put images inline in your email -- this can be much easier than referencing an external image. Email signatures are automatically excluded from conversion. Specifically, anything after the semi-standard '-- ' (note the trailing space) is left alone. Note that Hotmail and Yahoo do not automatically add the '-- ' to signatures, so you have to add it yourself. The 'Markdown Toggle' menu item shows up for more element types than it can correctly render. This is intended to help people realize that they're not using a rich editor. Otherwise they just don't see the menu item and don't know why. Styling: The use of browser-specific styles (-moz-, -webkit-) should be avoided. If used, they may not render correctly for people reading the email in a different browser from the one where the email was sent. The use of state-dependent styles (like a:hover) don't work because they don't match at the time the styles are made explicit. (In email, styles must be explicitly applied to all elements -- stylesheets get stripped.) For more tweaky features, visit the Tips and Tricks @link  section."

3133,460078,4,JavaScript,"MVC, no, MV done the right way!. MVC @link , short for Model-View-Controller, is a design pattern, i.e. how the code should be organized and how the different parts of an application separated for proper readability and debugging. Model is the data and the database. View is the user interface and what the user sees. Controller is the main link between Model and View. These are the three pillars of major programming frameworks present on the market today. On the other hand AngularJS works on MV, short for Model-View-_Whatever_. The _Whatever_ is AngularJS's way of telling that you may create any kind of linking between the Model and the View here. Unlike other frameworks in any programming language, where MVC, the three separate components, each one has to be written and then connected by the programmer, AngularJS helps the programmer by asking him/her to just create these and everything else will be taken care of by AngularJS."
3134,460078,4,JavaScript,"Interconnection with HTML at the root level. AngularJS uses HTML to define the user's interface. AngularJS also enables the programmer to write new HTML tags (AngularJS Directives) and increase the readability and understandability of the HTML code. Directives are AngularJS’s way of bringing additional functionality to HTML. Directives achieve this by enabling us to invent our own HTML elements. This also helps in making the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), which means once created, a new directive can be used anywhere within the application. HTML is also used to determine the wiring of the app. Special attributes in the HTML determine where to load the app, which components or controllers to use for each element, etc. We specify 'what' gets loaded, but not 'how'. This declarative approach greatly simplifies app development in a sort of WYSIWYG way. Rather than spending time on how the program flows and orchestrating the various moving parts, we simply define what we want and AngularJS will take care of the dependencies."
3135,460078,4,JavaScript,Data Handling made simple. Data and Data Models in AngularJS are plain JavaScript objects and one can add and change properties directly on it and loop over objects and arrays at will.
3136,460078,4,JavaScript,"Two-way Data Binding. One of AngularJS's strongest features. Two-way Data Binding means that if something changes in the Model, the change gets reflected in the View instantaneously, and the same happens the other way around. This is also referred to as Reactive Programming, i.e. suppose a  b  c is being programmed and after this, if the value of b and/or c is changed then the value of a will be automatically updated to reflect the change. AngularJS uses its 'scopes' as a glue between the Model and View and makes these updates in one available for the other."
3137,460078,4,JavaScript,"Less Written Code and Easily Maintainable Code. Everything in AngularJS is created to enable the programmer to end up writing less code that is easily maintainable and readable by any other new person on the team. Believe it or not, one can write a complete working two-way data binded application in less than 10 lines of code. Try and see for yourself!"
3138,460078,4,JavaScript,"Testing Ready. AngularJS has Dependency Injection, i.e. it takes care of providing all the necessary dependencies to its controllers and services whenever required. This helps in making the AngularJS code ready for unit testing by making use of mock dependencies created and injected. This makes AngularJS more modular and easily testable thus in turn helping a team create more robust applications."

New releases (at this time the 3.2.3, although we're currently working on our next major) are tracked on the yarnpkg/berry @link  repository, this one here being mostly kept for historical purposes and the occasional hotfix we publish to make the migration from 1.x to later releases easier. If you hit bugs or issues with Yarn 1.x, we strongly suggest you migrate @link  to the latest release - at this point they have been maintained longer than 1.x, and many classes of problems have already been addressed there. By using the nodeLinker setting @link  you'll also have the choice of how you want to install your packages: node_modules like npm, symlinks like pnpm, or manifest files via Yarn PnP @link .. --- Fast, reliable, and secure dependency management. --- Fast: Yarn caches every package it has downloaded, so it never needs to download the same package again. It also does almost everything concurrently to maximize resource utilization. This means even faster installs. Reliable: Using a detailed but concise lockfile format and a deterministic algorithm for install operations, Yarn is able to guarantee that any installation that works on one system will work exactly the same on another system. Secure: Yarn uses checksums to verify the integrity of every installed package before its code is executed."

The same dependencies will be installed in the same exact way on any machine, regardless of installation order. Network Performance. Yarn efficiently queues requests and avoids request waterfalls in order to maximize network utilization. Network Resilience. A single request that fails will not cause the entire installation to fail. Requests are automatically retried upon failure. Flat Mode. Yarn resolves mismatched versions of dependencies to a single version to avoid creating duplicates. More emojis."

The playground is the best way to learn about how to use the editor, which features is supports, to try out different versions and to create minimal reproducible examples for bug reports."
3197,60630844,2,JavaScript,"Installing. @Code You will get: - inside /esm: ESM version of the editor (compatible with e.g. webpack) - inside /dev: AMD bundled, not minified - inside /min: AMD bundled, and minified - inside /min-maps: source maps for min - monaco.d.ts: this specifies the API of the editor (this is what is actually versioned, everything else is considered private and might break with any release). It is recommended to develop against the dev version, and in production to use the min version."
3198,60630844,2,JavaScript,"Concepts. Monaco editor is best known for being the text editor that powers VS Code. However, it's a bit more nuanced. Some basic understanding about the underlying concepts is needed to use Monaco editor effectively."
3199,60630844,3,JavaScript,"Models. Models are at the heart of Monaco editor. It's what you interact with when managing content. A model represents a file that has been opened. This could represent a file that exists on a file system, but it doesn't have to. For example, the model holds the text content, determines the language of the content, and tracks the edit history of the content."
3200,60630844,3,JavaScript,"URIs. Each model is identified by a URI. This is why it's not possible for two models to have the same URI. Ideally when you represent content in Monaco editor, you should think of a virtual file system that matches the files your users are editing. For example, you could use file:/// as a base path. If a model is created without a URI, its URI will be inmemory://model/1. The number increases as more models are created."
3201,60630844,3,JavaScript,"Editors. An editor is a user facing view of the model. This is what gets attached to the DOM and what your users see visually. Typical editor operations are displaying a model, managing the view state, or executing actions or commands."
3202,60630844,3,JavaScript,"Providers. Providers provide smart editor features. For example, this includes completion and hover information. It is not the same as, but often maps to language server protocol @link  features. Providers work on models. Some smart features depends on the file URI. For example, for TypeScript to resolve imports, or for JSON IntelliSense to determine which JSON schema to apply to which model. So it's important to choose proper model URIs."
3203,60630844,3,JavaScript,"Disposables. Many Monaco related objects often implement the .dispose() method. This method is intended to perform cleanups when a resource is no longer needed. For example, calling model.dispose() will unregister it, freeing up the URI for a new model. Editors should be disposed to free up resources and remove their model listeners."

3205,60630844,2,JavaScript,Issues. Create issues @link  in this repository for anything related to the Monaco Editor. Please search for existing issues to avoid duplicates.
3206,60630844,2,JavaScript,"FAQ. What is the relationship between VS Code and the Monaco Editor? The Monaco Editor is generated straight from VS Code's sources with some shims around services the code needs to make it run in a web browser outside of its home. What is the relationship between VS Code's version and the Monaco Editor's version? None. The Monaco Editor is a library and it reflects directly the source code. I've written an extension for VS Code, will it work on the Monaco Editor in a browser? No. Note: If the extension is fully based on the LSP @link  and if the language server is authored in JavaScript, then it would be possible. Why all these web workers and why should I care? Language services create web workers to compute heavy stuff outside of the UI thread. They cost hardly anything in terms of resource overhead and you shouldn't worry too much about them, as long as you get them to work (see above the cross-domain case). What is this loader.js? Can I use require.js? It is an AMD loader that we use in VS Code. Yes. I see the warning 'Could not create web worker'. What should I do? HTML5 does not allow pages loaded on file:// to create web workers. Please load the editor with a web server on  @link or  @link schemes. Is the editor supported in mobile browsers or mobile web app frameworks? No. Why doesn't the editor support TextMate grammars? - Please see  @link which puts together monaco-editor, vscode-oniguruma and vscode-textmate to get TM grammar support in the editor."

3222,63537249,2,JavaScript,"Philosophy. - One Dependency: There is only one build dependency. It uses webpack, Babel, ESLint, and other amazing projects, but provides a cohesive curated experience on top of them. - No Configuration Required: You don't need to configure anything. A reasonably good configuration of both development and production builds is handled for you so you can focus on writing code. - No Lock-In: You can “eject” to a custom setup at any time. Run a single command, and all the configuration and build dependencies will be moved directly into your project, so you can pick up right where you left off."
3223,63537249,2,JavaScript,"What’s Included?. Your environment will have everything you need to build a modern single-page React app: - React, JSX, ES6, TypeScript and Flow syntax support. - Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator. - Autoprefixed CSS, so you don’t need -webkit- or other prefixes. - A fast interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting. - A live development server that warns about common mistakes. - A build script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production, with hashes and sourcemaps. - An offline-first service worker @link  and a web app manifest @link , meeting all the Progressive Web App @link  criteria. (_Note: Using the service worker is opt-in as of react-scripts@2.0.0 and higher_) - Hassle-free updates for the above tools with a single dependency.

If your project needs more customization, you can 'eject' @link  and customize it, but then you will need to maintain this configuration.."
3224,63537249,2,JavaScript,"Popular Alternatives. Create React App is a great fit for: - Learning React in a comfortable and feature-rich development environment. - Starting new single-page React applications. - Creating examples with React for your libraries and components. Here are a few common cases where you might want to try something else: - If you want to try React without hundreds of transitive build tool dependencies, consider using a single HTML file or an online sandbox instead @link .. - If you need to integrate React code with a server-side template framework like Rails, Django or Symfony, or if you’re not building a single-page app, consider using nwb @link , or Neutrino @link  which are more flexible. For Rails specifically, you can use Rails Webpacker @link . For Symfony, try Symfony's webpack Encore @link . - If you need to publish a React component, nwb @link  can also do this @link , as well as Neutrino's react-components preset @link .. - If you want to do server rendering with React and Node.js, check out Next.js @link  or Razzle @link . Create React App is agnostic of the backend, and only produces static HTML/JS/CSS bundles. - If your website is mostly static (for example, a portfolio or a blog), consider using Gatsby @link  or Next.js @link . Unlike Create React App, Gatsby pre-renders the website into HTML at build time. Next.js supports both server rendering and pre-rendering. - Finally, if you need more customization, check out Neutrino @link  and its React preset @link . All of the above tools can work with little to no configuration. If you prefer configuring the build yourself, follow this guide @link ."

3298,6498492,2,JavaScript,"References. - 2.1(references--prefer-const) Use const for all of your references; avoid using var. eslint: prefer-const @link , no-const-assign @link . Why? This ensures that you can’t reassign your references, which can lead to bugs and difficult to comprehend code. @Code - 2.2(references--disallow-var) If you must reassign references, use let instead of var. eslint: no-var @link . Why? let is block-scoped rather than function-scoped like var. @Code - 2.3(references--block-scope) Note that both let and const are block-scoped, whereas var is function-scoped.. @Code In the above code, you can see that referencing a and b will produce a ReferenceError, while c contains the number. This is because a and b are block scoped, while c is scoped to the containing function. back to top(table-of-contents)."

Why? They allow you to define all the properties of an object in one place. @Code - 3.3(es6-object-shorthand) Use object method shorthand. eslint: object-shorthand @link . @Code - 3.4(es6-object-concise) Use property value shorthand. eslint: object-shorthand @link . Why? It is shorter and descriptive. @Code - 3.5(objects--grouped-shorthand) Group your shorthand properties at the beginning of your object declaration.. Why? It’s easier to tell which properties are using the shorthand. @Code - 3.6(objects--quoted-props) Only quote properties that are invalid identifiers. eslint: quote-props @link . Why? In general we consider it subjectively easier to read. It improves syntax highlighting, and is also more easily optimized by many JS engines. @Code - 3.7(objects--prototype-builtins) Do not call Object.prototype methods directly, such as hasOwnProperty, propertyIsEnumerable, and isPrototypeOf. eslint: no-prototype-builtins @link . Why? These methods may be shadowed by properties on the object in question - consider { hasOwnProperty: false } - or, the object may be a null object (Object.create(null)). In modern browsers that support ES2022, or with a polyfill such as , Object.hasOwn can also be used as an alternative to Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call. @Code - 3.8(objects--rest-spread) Prefer the object spread syntax over Object.assign @link  to shallow-copy objects.

3301,6498492,2,JavaScript,"Classes & Constructors. - 9.1(constructors--use-class) Always use class. Avoid manipulating prototype directly.. Why? class syntax is more concise and easier to reason about. @Code - 9.2(constructors--extends) Use extends for inheritance.. Why? It is a built-in way to inherit prototype functionality without breaking instanceof. @Code - 9.3(constructors--chaining) Methods can return this to help with method chaining.. @Code - 9.4(constructors--tostring) It’s okay to write a custom toString() method, just make sure it works successfully and causes no side effects.. @Code - 9.5(constructors--no-useless) Classes have a default constructor if one is not specified. An empty constructor function or one that just delegates to a parent class is unnecessary. eslint: no-useless-constructor @link . @Code - 9.6(classes--no-duplicate-members) Avoid duplicate class members. eslint: no-dupe-class-members @link . Why? Duplicate class member declarations will silently prefer the last one - having duplicates is almost certainly a bug. @Code - 9.7(classes--methods-use-this) Class methods should use this or be made into a static method unless an external library or framework requires using specific non-static methods. Being an instance method should indicate that it behaves differently based on properties of the receiver. eslint: class-methods-use-this @link . @Code back to top(table-of-contents)."
3302,6498492,2,JavaScript,"Modules. - 10.1(modules--use-them) Always use modules (import/export) over a non-standard module system. You can always transpile to your preferred module system.. Why? Modules are the future, let’s start using the future now. @Code - 10.2(modules--no-wildcard) Do not use wildcard imports.. Why? This makes sure you have a single default export. @Code - 10.3(modules--no-export-from-import) And do not export directly from an import.. Why? Although the one-liner is concise, having one clear way to import and one clear way to export makes things consistent. @Code - 10.4(modules--no-duplicate-imports) Only import from a path in one place.. eslint: no-duplicate-imports @link Why? Having multiple lines that import from the same path can make code harder to maintain. @Code - 10.5(modules--no-mutable-exports) Do not export mutable bindings.. eslint: import/no-mutable-exports @link Why? Mutation should be avoided in general, but in particular when exporting mutable bindings. While this technique may be needed for some special cases, in general, only constant references should be exported. @Code - 10.6(modules--prefer-default-export) In modules with a single export, prefer default export over named export.. eslint: import/prefer-default-export @link Why? To encourage more files that only ever export one thing, which is better for readability and maintainability. @Code - 10.7(modules--imports-first) Put all imports above non-import statements.. eslint: import/first @link Why? Since imports are hoisted, keeping them all at the top prevents surprising behavior. @Code - 10.8(modules--multiline-imports-over-newlines) Multiline imports should be indented just like multiline array and object literals.. eslint: object-curly-newline @link Why? The curly braces follow the same indentation rules as every other curly brace block in the style guide, as do the trailing commas. @Code - 10.9(modules--no-webpack-loader-syntax) Disallow Webpack loader syntax in module import statements.. eslint: import/no-webpack-loader-syntax @link Why? Since using Webpack syntax in the imports couples the code to a module bundler. Prefer using the loader syntax in webpack.config.js. @Code - 10.10(modules--import-extensions) Do not include JavaScript filename extensions. eslint: import/extensions @link Why? Including extensions inhibits refactoring, and inappropriately hardcodes implementation details of the module you're importing in every consumer. @Code back to top(table-of-contents)."
3303,6498492,2,JavaScript,"Iterators and Generators. - 11.1(iterators--nope) Don’t use iterators. Prefer JavaScript’s higher-order functions instead of loops like for-in or for-of. eslint: no-iterator @link  no-restricted-syntax @link . Why? This enforces our immutable rule. Dealing with pure functions that return values is easier to reason about than side effects. Use map() / every() / filter() / find() / findIndex() / reduce() / some() / ... to iterate over arrays, and Object.keys() / Object.values() / Object.entries() to produce arrays so you can iterate over objects. @Code - 11.2(generators--nope) Don’t use generators for now.. Why? They don’t transpile well to ES5. - 11.3(generators--spacing) If you must use generators, or if you disregard our advice(generators--nope), make sure their function signature is spaced properly. eslint: generator-star-spacing @link . Why? function and  are part of the same conceptual keyword -  is not a modifier for function, function is a unique construct, different from function. @Code back to top(table-of-contents)."
3304,6498492,2,JavaScript,Properties. - 12.1(properties--dot) Use dot notation when accessing properties. eslint: dot-notation @link . @Code - 12.2(properties--bracket) Use bracket notation  when accessing properties with a variable.. @Code - 12.3(es2016-properties--exponentiation-operator) Use exponentiation operator  when calculating exponentiations. eslint: prefer-exponentiation-operator @link .. @Code back to top(table-of-contents).
3305,6498492,2,JavaScript,"Variables. - 13.1(variables--const) Always use const or let to declare variables. Not doing so will result in global variables. We want to avoid polluting the global namespace. Captain Planet warned us of that. eslint: no-undef @link  prefer-const @link . @Code - 13.2(variables--one-const) Use one const or let declaration per variable or assignment. eslint: one-var @link . Why? It’s easier to add new variable declarations this way, and you never have to worry about swapping out a ; for a , or introducing punctuation-only diffs. You can also step through each declaration with the debugger, instead of jumping through all of them at once. @Code - 13.3(variables--const-let-group) Group all your consts and then group all your lets.. Why? This is helpful when later on you might need to assign a variable depending on one of the previously assigned variables. @Code - 13.4(variables--define-where-used) Assign variables where you need them, but place them in a reasonable place.. Why? let and const are block scoped and not function scoped. @Code - 13.5(variables--no-chain-assignment) Don’t chain variable assignments. eslint: no-multi-assign @link . Why? Chaining variable assignments creates implicit global variables. @Code - 13.6(variables--unary-increment-decrement) Avoid using unary increments and decrements (, --). eslint no-plusplus @link . Why? Per the eslint documentation, unary increment and decrement statements are subject to automatic semicolon insertion and can cause silent errors with incrementing or decrementing values within an application. It is also more expressive to mutate your values with statements like num  1 instead of num or num . Disallowing unary increment and decrement statements also prevents you from pre-incrementing/pre-decrementing values unintentionally which can also cause unexpected behavior in your programs. @Code - 13.7(variables--linebreak) Avoid linebreaks before or after  in an assignment. If your assignment violates max-len @link , surround the value in parens. eslint operator-linebreak @link .. Why? Linebreaks surrounding  can obfuscate the value of an assignment. @Code - 13.8(variables--no-unused-vars) Disallow unused variables. eslint: no-unused-vars @link . Why? Variables that are declared and not used anywhere in the code are most likely an error due to incomplete refactoring. Such variables take up space in the code and can lead to confusion by readers. @Code back to top(table-of-contents)."
3306,6498492,2,JavaScript,"Hoisting. - 14.1(hoisting--about) var declarations get hoisted to the top of their closest enclosing function scope, their assignment does not. const and let declarations are blessed with a new concept called Temporal Dead Zones (TDZ) @link . It’s important to know why typeof is no longer safe @link .. @Code - 14.2(hoisting--anon-expressions) Anonymous function expressions hoist their variable name, but not the function assignment.. @Code - 14.3(hoisting--named-expressions) Named function expressions hoist the variable name, not the function name or the function body.. @Code - 14.4(hoisting--declarations) Function declarations hoist their name and the function body.. @Code - 14.5(no-use-before-define) Variables, classes, and functions should be defined before they can be used. eslint: no-use-before-define @link . Why? When variables, classes, or functions are declared after being used, it can harm readability since a reader won't know what a thing that's referenced is. It's much clearer for a reader to first encounter the source of a thing (whether imported from another module, or defined in the file) before encountering a use of the thing. @Code - For more information refer to JavaScript Scoping & Hoisting @link  by Ben Cherry @link . back to top(table-of-contents)."
3307,6498492,2,JavaScript,"Comparison Operators & Equality. - 15.1(comparison--eqeqeq) Use  and ! over  and !. eslint: eqeqeq @link . - 15.2(comparison--if) Conditional statements such as the if statement evaluate their expression using coercion with the ToBoolean abstract method and always follow these simple rules:. - Objects evaluate to true - Undefined evaluates to false - Null evaluates to false - Booleans evaluate to the value of the boolean - Numbers evaluate to false if 0, -0, or NaN, otherwise true - Strings evaluate to false if an empty string '', otherwise true @Code - 15.3(comparison--shortcuts) Use shortcuts for booleans, but explicit comparisons for strings and numbers.. @Code - 15.4(comparison--moreinfo) For more information see Truth, Equality, and JavaScript @link  by Angus Croll.. - 15.5(comparison--switch-blocks) Use braces to create blocks in case and default clauses that contain lexical declarations (e.g. let, const, function, and class). eslint: no-case-declarations @link . Why? Lexical declarations are visible in the entire switch block but only get initialized when assigned, which only happens when its case is reached. This causes problems when multiple case clauses attempt to define the same thing. @Code - 15.6(comparison--nested-ternaries) Ternaries should not be nested and generally be single line expressions. eslint: no-nested-ternary @link . @Code - 15.7(comparison--unneeded-ternary) Avoid unneeded ternary statements. eslint: no-unneeded-ternary @link . @Code - 15.8(comparison--no-mixed-operators) When mixing operators, enclose them in parentheses. The only exception is the standard arithmetic operators: , -, and  since their precedence is broadly understood. We recommend enclosing / and  in parentheses because their precedence can be ambiguous when they are mixed.. eslint: no-mixed-operators @link Why? This improves readability and clarifies the developer’s intention. @Code - 15.9(nullish-coalescing-operator) The nullish coalescing operator (??) is a logical operator that returns its right-hand side operand when its left-hand side operand is null or undefined. Otherwise, it returns the left-hand side operand.. Why? It provides precision by distinguishing null/undefined from other falsy values, enhancing code clarity and predictability. @Code back to top(table-of-contents)."
3308,6498492,2,JavaScript,"Blocks. - 16.1(blocks--braces) Use braces with all multiline blocks. eslint: nonblock-statement-body-position @link . @Code - 16.2(blocks--cuddled-elses) If you’re using multiline blocks with if and else, put else on the same line as your if block’s closing brace. eslint: brace-style @link . @Code - 16.3(blocks--no-else-return) If an if block always executes a return statement, the subsequent else block is unnecessary. A return in an else if block following an if block that contains a return can be separated into multiple if blocks. eslint: no-else-return @link . @Code back to top(table-of-contents)."
3309,6498492,2,JavaScript,"Control Statements. - 17.1(control-statements) In case your control statement (if, while etc.) gets too long or exceeds the maximum line length, each (grouped) condition could be put into a new line. The logical operator should begin the line.. Why? Requiring operators at the beginning of the line keeps the operators aligned and follows a pattern similar to method chaining. This also improves readability by making it easier to visually follow complex logic. @Code - 17.2(control-statements--value-selection) Don't use selection operators in place of control statements.. @Code back to top(table-of-contents)."
3310,6498492,2,JavaScript,"Comments. - 18.1(comments--multiline) Use / ... / for multiline comments.. @Code - 18.2(comments--singleline) Use // for single line comments. Place single line comments on a newline above the subject of the comment. Put an empty line before the comment unless it’s on the first line of a block.. @Code - 18.3(comments--spaces) Start all comments with a space to make it easier to read. eslint: spaced-comment @link . @Code - 18.4(comments--actionitems) Prefixing your comments with FIXME or TODO helps other developers quickly understand if you’re pointing out a problem that needs to be revisited, or if you’re suggesting a solution to the problem that needs to be implemented. These are different than regular comments because they are actionable. The actions are FIXME: -- need to figure this out or TODO: -- need to implement.. - 18.5(comments--fixme) Use // FIXME: to annotate problems.. @Code - 18.6(comments--todo) Use // TODO: to annotate solutions to problems.. @Code back to top(table-of-contents)."

3313,6498492,2,JavaScript,"Semicolons. - 21.1(semicolons--required) Yup. eslint: semi @link . Why? When JavaScript encounters a line break without a semicolon, it uses a set of rules called Automatic Semicolon Insertion @link  to determine whether it should regard that line break as the end of a statement, and (as the name implies) place a semicolon into your code before the line break if it thinks so. ASI contains a few eccentric behaviors, though, and your code will break if JavaScript misinterprets your line break. These rules will become more complicated as new features become a part of JavaScript. Explicitly terminating your statements and configuring your linter to catch missing semicolons will help prevent you from encountering issues.. @Code Read more @link .. back to top(table-of-contents)."
3314,6498492,2,JavaScript,"Type Casting & Coercion. - 22.1(coercion--explicit) Perform type coercion at the beginning of the statement.. - 22.2(coercion--strings) Strings: eslint: no-new-wrappers @link . @Code - 22.3(coercion--numbers) Numbers: Use Number for type casting and parseInt always with a radix for parsing strings. eslint: radix @link  no-new-wrappers @link . Why? The parseInt function produces an integer value dictated by interpretation of the contents of the string argument according to the specified radix. Leading whitespace in string is ignored. If radix is undefined or 0, it is assumed to be 10 except when the number begins with the character pairs 0x or 0X, in which case a radix of 16 is assumed. This differs from ECMAScript 3, which merely discouraged (but allowed) octal interpretation. Many implementations have not adopted this behavior as of 2013. And, because older browsers must be supported, always specify a radix. @Code - 22.4(coercion--comment-deviations) If for whatever reason you are doing something wild and parseInt is your bottleneck and need to use Bitshift for performance reasons @link , leave a comment explaining why and what you’re doing.. @Code - 22.5(coercion--bitwise) Note: Be careful when using bitshift operations. Numbers are represented as 64-bit values @link , but bitshift operations always return a 32-bit integer (source @link ). Bitshift can lead to unexpected behavior for integer values larger than 32 bits. Discussion @link .

3315,6498492,2,JavaScript,"Naming Conventions. - 23.1(naming--descriptive) Avoid single letter names. Be descriptive with your naming. eslint: id-length @link . @Code - 23.2(naming--camelCase) Use camelCase when naming objects, functions, and instances. eslint: camelcase @link . @Code - 23.3(naming--PascalCase) Use PascalCase only when naming constructors or classes. eslint: new-cap @link . @Code - 23.4(naming--leading-underscore) Do not use trailing or leading underscores. eslint: no-underscore-dangle @link . Why? JavaScript does not have the concept of privacy in terms of properties or methods. Although a leading underscore is a common convention to mean “private”, in fact, these properties are fully public, and as such, are part of your public API contract. This convention might lead developers to wrongly think that a change won’t count as breaking, or that tests aren’t needed. tl;dr: if you want something to be “private”, it must not be observably present. @Code - 23.5(naming--self-this) Don’t save references to this. Use arrow functions or Functionbind @link .. @Code - 23.6(naming--filename-matches-export) A base filename should exactly match the name of its default export.. @Code - 23.7(naming--camelCase-default-export) Use camelCase when you export-default a function. Your filename should be identical to your function’s name.. @Code - 23.8(naming--PascalCase-singleton) Use PascalCase when you export a constructor / class / singleton / function library / bare object.. @Code - 23.9(naming--Acronyms-and-Initialisms) Acronyms and initialisms should always be all uppercased, or all lowercased.. Why? Names are for readability, not to appease a computer algorithm. @Code - 23.10(naming--uppercase) You may optionally uppercase a constant only if it (1) is exported, (2) is a const (it can not be reassigned), and (3) the programmer can trust it (and its nested properties) to never change.. Why? This is an additional tool to assist in situations where the programmer would be unsure if a variable might ever change. UPPERCASE_VARIABLES are letting the programmer know that they can trust the variable (and its properties) not to change. - What about all const variables? - This is unnecessary, so uppercasing should not be used for constants within a file. It should be used for exported constants however. - What about exported objects? - Uppercase at the top level of export (e.g. EXPORTED_OBJECT.key) and maintain that all nested properties do not change. @Code back to top(table-of-contents)."
3316,6498492,2,JavaScript,"Accessors. - 24.1(accessors--not-required) Accessor functions for properties are not required.. - 24.2(accessors--no-getters-setters) Do not use JavaScript getters/setters as they cause unexpected side effects and are harder to test, maintain, and reason about. Instead, if you do make accessor functions, use getVal() and setVal('hello').. @Code - 24.3(accessors--boolean-prefix) If the property/method is a boolean, use isVal() or hasVal().. @Code - 24.4(accessors--consistent) It’s okay to create get() and set() functions, but be consistent.. @Code back to top(table-of-contents)."
3317,6498492,2,JavaScript,"Events. - 25.1(events--hash) When attaching data payloads to events (whether DOM events or something more proprietary like Backbone events), pass an object literal (also known as a 'hash') instead of a raw value.

Add these tags to your document's : @Code For the latest version of video.js and URLs to use, check out the Getting Startedgetting-started page on our website. Video.js version 7 (and newer) CDN builds do not send any data to Google Analytics. In older versions of Video.js (6 and earlier), in the vjs.zencdn.net CDN-hosted versions we include a stripped down Google Analytics pixel @link  that tracks a random sampling (currently 1%) of players loaded from the CDN. This allows us to see (roughly) what browsers are in use in the wild, along with other useful metrics such as OS and device. If you'd like to disable analytics, you can simply include the following global before including Video.js via the free CDN: @Code Alternatively, you can include Video.js by getting it from npm @link , downloading from GitHub releases @link  or by including it via unpkg @link  or another JavaScript CDN like CDNjs. These releases _do not_ include Google Analytics tracking at all.. @Code Next, using Video.js is as simple as creating a  element, but with an additional data-setup attribute. At a minimum, this attribute must have a value of '{}', but it can include any Video.js optionsoptions - just make sure it contains valid JSON! @Code When the page loads, Video.js will find this element and automatically setup a player in its place. If you don't want to use automatic setup, you can leave off the data-setup attribute and initialize a  element manually using the videojs function: @Code The videojs function also accepts an options object and a callback to be invoked when the player is ready: @Code If you're ready to dive in, the Getting Startedgetting-started page and documentationdocs are the best places to go for more information.

On Linux and macOS, eDEX tracks where you're going in your terminal tab to display the content of the current folder on-screen. Sadly, this is technically impossible to do on Windows right now, so the file browser reverts back to a 'detached' mode. You can still use it to browse files & directories and click on files to input their path in the terminal."

You'll notice there's a script tag that is pulling in a build of Phaser 3, but otherwise this webpage doesn't do anything yet. Now let's set-up the game config. Paste the following between the  tags: @Code config is a pretty standard Phaser 3 Game Configuration object. We tell config to use the WebGL renderer if it can, set the canvas to a size of 800 x 600 pixels, enable Arcade Physics, and finally we tell it to use the Example Scene. This hasn't been implemented yet, so if you run this JavaScript code now you will have an error. Add the following above the config: @Code Here we create a Scene called Example. We've given it 2 functions. The preload function is where you load assets into your game. In preload, we set the Base URL to be the Phaser server and load 3 PNG files. The create function is empty, so it's time to fill it in: @Code Here we add a sky image into the game and create a Particle Emitter. The scale value means that the particles will initially be large and will shrink to nothing as their lifespan progresses. After creating the emitter, we add a logo image called logo. Since logo is a Physics Image, logo is given a physics body by default. We set some properties for logo: velocity, bounce (or restitution), and collision with the world bounds. These properties will make our logo bounce around the screen. Finally, we tell the particle emitter to follow the logo - so as the logo moves, the particles will flow from it. Run it in your browser and you'll see the following: If you can't get it to run, then have a look at this example in the Phaser Sandbox @link . This is a tiny example, and there are hundreds more for you to explore, but hopefully it shows how expressive and quick Phaser is to use. With just a few easily readable lines of code, we've got something pretty impressive up on screen! There are both plain and minified compiled versions of Phaser in the dist folder of the repository.

3425,99598595,2,JavaScript,"Why parcel?. There are many web application bundlers out there with huge adoption, including webpack and browserify. So, why do we need another one? The main reasons are around developer experience. Many bundlers are built around configuration and plugins, and it is not uncommon to see applications with upwards of 500 lines of configuration just to get things working. This configuration is not just tedious and time consuming, but is also hard to get right and must be duplicated for each application. Oftentimes, this can lead to sub-optimized apps shipping to production. parcel is designed to need zero configuration: just point it at the entry point of your application, and it does the right thing. Existing bundlers are also _very_ slow. Large applications with lots of files and many dependencies can take minutes to build, which is especially painful during development, when things change all the time. File watchers can help with rebuilds, but the initial launch is often still very slow. parcel utilizes worker processes to compile your code in parallel, utilizing modern multicore processors. This results in a huge boost in speed for initial builds. It also has a file system cache, which saves the compiled results per file, for even faster subsequent startups. Finally, existing bundlers are built around string loaders/transforms, where the transform takes in a string, parses it, does some transformation, and generates code again. Oftentimes, this ends up causing many parses and code generation runs on a single file, which is inefficient. Instead, parcel's transforms work on ASTs, so that there is one parse, many transforms, and one code generation per file."

Many other bundlers are fundamentally based around JavaScript assets, with other formats tacked on - for example, by default inlined as strings into JS files. parcel is file-type agnostic - it will work with any type of assets the way you'd expect, with no configuration. parcel takes as input a single entry asset, which could be any file type: JS, HTML, CSS, image, etc. There are various asset types defined in parcel which know how to handle specific file types. The assets are parsed, their dependencies are extracted, and they are transformed to their final compiled form. This creates a tree of assets. Once the asset tree has been constructed, the assets are placed into a bundle tree. A bundle is created for the entry asset, and child bundles are created for dynamic imports, which cause code splitting to occur. Child bundles are also created when assets of a different type are imported. For example, if you imported a CSS file from JavaScript, it would be placed into a sibling bundle in correlation to the associated JavaScript file. If an asset is required in more than one bundle, it is hoisted up to the nearest common ancestor in the bundle tree, so it is not included more than once. After the bundle tree is constructed, each bundle is written to a file by a packager specific to the file type. The packagers know how to combine the code from each asset together into the final file that is loaded by a browser."
